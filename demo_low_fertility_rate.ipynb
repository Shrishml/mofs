It traces the market\\'s historic and forecast market growth by geography.\\n\\nThe assisted reproductive technology market size has grown strongly in recent years. It will grow from $34.35 billion in 2024 to $37.21 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to increase in infertility rates, changing societal norms, growing awareness, legislative support, aging population.  \\nThe assisted reproductive technology market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $52.84 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to increasing maternal age, rising demand for same-sex parenting, medical tourism, expanding healthcare infrastructure, research and development. Major trends in the forecast period include use of artificial intelligence (AI), egg freezing, single-embryo transfer (SET), PGT-A and genetic screening, innovative fertility preservation techniques.  \\nThe assisted reproductive technology market is anticipated to experience growth due to the increasing number of infertility cases. Infertility, diagnosed after a year of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, impacts a significant portion of the global adult population, affecting approximately 1 in 6 adults or 17.5% globally, as stated by the World Health Organization in April 2023. As a result, the rising prevalence of infertility cases is propelling the demand for assisted reproductive technology (ART), which encompasses fertility treatments involving both male and female reproductive components.  \\nThe escalating prevalence of obesity is poised to drive the growth of the ART market in the future. The World Heart Federation reported in March 2023 that around 2.3 billion individuals, including adults and children, were affected by obesity or being overweight globally. Projections indicate that by 2025, this number may soar to 2.7 billion, underscoring the significant impact of obesity on fertility and the subsequent demand for specialized ART services.  \\nA prominent trend shaping the ART market is the advancement of technology. Leading companies are actively developing technological solutions to fortify their positions within the industry. Notably, Alife Health introduced the Alife Assist platform in October 2022, an innovative suite of products leveraging data-driven insights and artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) process. This platform, consisting of Stim Assist, Embryo Assist, and Insights, caters to reproductive endocrinologists, embryologists, and clinic administrators, aiding in clinical decision-making, streamlining IVF clinic operations, and optimizing medication dosing, embryo grading, and real-time performance monitoring. The implementation of such technology not only enhances the patient experience but also improves success rates in IVF procedures.  \\nLeading companies in the assisted reproductive technology (ART) sector are spearheading the development of innovative products to gain a competitive edge in the market. For example, in July 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., a renowned US-based biotechnology firm, introduced two pioneering next-generation sequencing-based options specifically crafted to support preimplantation genetic testing-aneuploidy (PGT-A) in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) research. The cutting-edge products, namely the Ion ReproSeq PGT-A Kit and the Ion AmpliSeq Polyploidy Kit, are tailored for use in reproductive health labs. These are the first research-use assays in the field, and they are compatible with the Ion Torrent Genexus Integrated Sequencer, providing a comprehensive workflow from the initial sample to the final result for aneuploidy analysis. PGT-A testing facilitates the identification of chromosomal irregularities in embryo samples, offering researchers invaluable genetic insights to potentially bolster the success rate of future pregnancies and improve the health of future generations. The Genexus Integrated Sequencer streamlines the research process by enabling templating, sequencing, and analysis on a single platform. Additionally, the Ion AmpliSeq Polyploidy Panel kit includes quality control features designed to detect contamination, prevent sample mix-ups, and identify triploidy in embryos.  \\nIn November 2023, CooperCompanies, a US-based medical device firm, acquired Cook Medical\\'s Reproductive Health business for $300 million. The products obtained in this acquisition complement CooperSurgical\\'s current portfolio of medical devices and strengthen the company\\'s position as a leading global provider in the fields of fertility and women\\'s health. Cook Medical is a US-based supplier of assisted reproductive technology.\\nReport Scope\\nMarkets Covered: \\n1) By Diagnosis: Ovulation Testing; Hysterosalpingography; Ovarian Reserve Testing; Genetic Testing\\n2) By Procedure Type: Fresh Non-Donor; Fresh Donor; Frozen Donor; Frozen Non-Donor; Embryo or Egg Banking\\n3) By End-User: Hospitals; Fertility Clinics; Other End-Users  \\nSubsegments: \\n1) By Ovulation Testing: Urine Ovulation Predictor Kits; Saliva Ovulation Test Kits\\n2) By Hysterosalpingography (HSG): X-ray HSG; Sonohysterography (SHG)\\n3) By Ovarian Reserve Testing: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Testing; Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Testing; Antral Follicle Count (AFC) via Ultrasound\\n4) By Genetic Testing: Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT); Carrier Screening Tests; Genetic Compatibility Testing  \\nKey Assisted Reproductive Technology Companies Profiled: Cooper Surgical Inc.; Ferring Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Hamilton Thorne Ltd.; Merck KGaA; Genea Limited  \\nCountries: Australia; Brazil; China; France; Germany; India; Indonesia; Japan; Russia; South Korea; UK; USA; Canada; Italy; Spain  \\nRegions: Asia-Pacific; Western Europe; Eastern Europe; North America; South America; Middle East; Africa  \\nTime Series: Five years historic and ten years forecast.  \\nData: Ratios of market size and growth to related markets, GDP proportions, expenditure per capita.  \\nData Segmentation: Country and regional historic and forecast data, market share of competitors, market segments.  \\nKey Attributes\\nReport AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages200Forecast Period2025-2029Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2025$37.21 BillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029$52.84 BillionCompound Annual Growth Rate9.2%Regions CoveredGlobal\\nThe major companies featured in this Assisted Reproductive Technology market report include:\\n\\nCooper Surgical Inc.\\nFerring Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\\nHamilton Thorne Ltd.\\nMerck KGaA\\nGenea Limited\\nCalifornia Cryobank\\nEuropean Sperm Bank\\nOvaScience Inc.\\nBloom IVF Centre\\nVitrolife AB\\nFUJIFILM Irvine Scientific Inc.\\nNidacon International AB\\nMonash IVF Group Ltd.\\nCook Medical\\nINVO Bioscience Inc.\\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\\nBoston Scientific Corporation\\nAnecova Sa\\nCarolinas Fertility Institute\\nMicrom Ltd.\\nInception Sciences Inc.\\nProgyny Inc.\\nOxford Gene Technology IP Ltd.\\nIVI-RMA Global\\nBoston IVF\\nCARE Fertility Group\\nVirtus Health\\nReproductive Medicine Associates of New York\\nShady Grove Fertility\\nCCRM Fertility\\nNew Hope Fertility Center\\nHouston Fertility Institute\\nPacific Fertility Center\\nRMA of New Jersey\\nSher Fertility Institute\\nIVF Florida\\nORM Fertility\\nHRC Fertility\\nArizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility\\nSan Diego Fertility Center\\nFertility Centers of Illinois\\n\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/icwq3x\\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world\\'s leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Reproductive Technology Market size was valued at around USD 34.7 billion in 2023 and is estimated to grow at 6.9% CAGR from 2024 to 2032. Assisted reproductive technology refers to a medical treatment procedure that addresses infertility problems. It includes in-vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. Increasing success rates of these procedures has offered more effective care solutions in hospitals, fertility clinics and surgical centers.\\n\\nThe rising prevalence of infertility across the population base serves as a significant driver for the ART market. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2023, around 17.5% of the adult population – roughly 1 in 6 worldwide experience infertility, showing the urgent need to increase access to affordable, high-quality fertility care for those in need. Further, as per the same report, lifetime infertility prevalence was 17.8% for high-income countries and 16.5% for low- and middle-income countries. As fertility rates decline globally, individuals and couples are increasingly turning to ART services to overcome infertility challenges and achieve their family-building goals.\\nFurthermore, increasing shift towards infertility treatment devices, rising adoption of infertility drugs, advancement in mother care products, rising healthcare expenditure globally, government initiatives and funding, and increasing education & awareness, are the increasing factors nurturing the growth of the market.\\nAssisted Reproductive Technology Market Trends\\nWith the evolution of societal attitudes and the growing acceptance of ART, there is a rising trend among individuals and couples to utilize these advanced reproductive technologies to surmount infertility challenges and achieve their aspirations of parenthood.\\n\\nOver time, societal norms and values regarding family formation, parenthood, and reproductive options have evolved. There is greater acceptance and recognition of diverse family structures, including single-parent families, same-sex couples, and individuals pursuing parenthood independently.\\n\\nFor instance, according to the Department of Health, State Government of Victoria, Australia, in 2024, single-male-parent families are the fastest growing family, increasing between 44% to 65% by 2041. As per the same report, single-female-parent families are projected to make up 13% to 14% of all families in 2041.\\n\\nFurther as per the recent statistics, in the 1950s, less than 10% of families with children were single parent, whereas in 2022, among families with children, 31% were single-parent — more than three times as common.\\n\\nIncreased cultural and religious acceptance of ART, coupled with a desire to adhere to cultural and religious values while addressing infertility, and utilizing fertility testing devices, leading to greater utilization of ART services among diverse populations, thereby stimulating the growth of the market.\\n\\n\\nART Market Analysis\\n\\nBased on type, the market is bifurcated into product and procedure. The procedure segment is estimated to account for USD 58.6 billion by 2032.\\n\\nThe prevalence of infertility is increasing globally due to various factors such as lifestyle changes, environmental factors, and delaying childbirth. As a result, more individuals and couples are seeking fertility treatments, fertility supplements, and adopting ART procedures, to achieve their goal of parenthood.\\n\\nIt encompasses various assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and artificial insemination. Increasing number of in-vitro fertilization increases the adoption rate of assisted reproductive technology.\\n\\nFor instance, according to the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in 2021, the number of children born through in vitro fertilization as part of infertility treatment increased by 9,416 from the previous year to a record high of 69,797 in Japan. Furthermore, the most common age for those receiving treatment was 39, with 39,631 cases, followed by those aged 40 and 41.\\n\\nContinuous advancements in ART technologies and techniques have significantly improved success rates and outcomes of procedures. Innovations such as time-lapse imaging, preimplantation genetic testing, and embryo vitrification have enhanced the efficacy and safety of ART procedures, leading to increased adoption and demand.\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on end-user/provider, the assisted reproductive technology market is divided into hospitals, fertility clinics, and other end-users/providers. The fertility clinics segment accounted for USD 18.8 billion in 2023.\\n\\nThese clinics are dedicated to reproductive medicine and have specialized expertise in diagnosing and treating infertility. They employ reproductive endocrinologists, fertility specialists, embryologists, and other healthcare professionals who are trained and experienced in ART procedures.\\n\\nIncrease in fertility clinics is a significant driver for the market leading to increased uptake of ART among the patients.\\n\\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, in 2023, India is witnessing a surge in IVF clinics and chains, with an estimated 2500 clinics functional across India.\\n\\nFurther, according to the National Library of Medicine, in 2021, a total of 601 fertility clinics in Japan performed treatments of assisted reproductive technology (ART).

But a new global ranking by TIME and Statista of the 250 top EdTech companies suggests that online learning is here to stay.\\nNine of the top 15 most successful EdTech companies in the world are focused on providing online learning. The rankings are based on a formula evaluating financial strength and industry impact.\\nEruditus, the top EdTech company in the global rankings, reported a revenue of close to $400 million for the financial year ending in June 2023, up 75% over the prior year. The EdTech platform offers online courses from more than 80 universities around the world, including business schools at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Cambridge, and MIT. Eruditus says it has so far educated more than 500,000 people across 80 countries.\\nEruditus was incorporated in Singapore but made news this year for reportedly shifting its headquarters to India. “It is a fact that the Indian stock markets are far more attractive than the global peers,\" co-founder and CEO Ashwin Damera told Indian news-outlet Mint in January.\\nThe U.S. dominates the list, making up more than one-third of the slots. China trails behind with 10% and the U.K. has just over 6%. Two companies from Brazil also made it into the top 10: Afya runs medical schools and offers online classes in various health fields; Vitru Education provides online and on-campus classes in Brazil to, the company reports, more than 900,000 undergraduate and graduate students.\\nBrazil’s EdTech market has been growing rapidly for years. The country has struggled with education. In Brazil, just 57% of adults aged 25 to 64 have completed upper secondary education, much lower than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country average of 79%, putting it nearly last among the 41 countries studied by the OECD for educational attainment. And the OECD\\'s 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranked Brazil 40 of 41 countries studied for students’ skills in reading, math, and sciences. The private sector has capitalized on the opportunity to offer online learning.\\n“Students that are older, that have worked for a bit, have some kind of education qualification but are upgrading so they can get a better job, they value convenience and affordability,” says Jitin Sethi, managing director at LEK Consulting, focused on education in the Americas. “That creates a unique opportunity to innovate.”\\nIn addition to highlighting 250 top EdTech companies, Statista and TIME also published a Rising Stars ranking to spotlight organizations that had the highest revenue growth rates over the last three years, of companies that submitted applications. Scaler Academy, an online learning platform based in India that teaches coding, system design, and career development skills, topped that list. —Sanya Mansoor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHome\\nU.S.\\nPolitics\\nWorld\\nHealth\\nBusiness\\nTech\\nPersonal Finance by TIME Stamped\\nShopping by TIME Stamped\\n\\nFuture of Work by Charter\\n\\n\\nEntertainment\\n\\nIdeas\\nScience\\nHistory\\nSports\\nMagazine\\nThe TIME Vault\\nTIME For Kids\\nTIMECO2\\n\\nCoupons\\n\\n\\nTIME Edge\\n\\nVideo\\nMasthead\\nNewsletters\\nSubscribe\\nDigital Magazine\\nGive a Gift\\nShop the TIME Store\\nCareers\\n\\nModern Slavery Statement\\n\\n\\nPress Room\\n\\nTIME Studios\\nU.S. & Canada Customer Care\\nGlobal Help Center\\nContact the Editors\\nReprints and Permissions\\nSite Map\\nMedia Kit\\nSupplied Partner Content\\nAbout Us\\n\\n© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

This article delves into the current trends, challenges, and future foresight regarding real estate in the assisted living sector. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors, operators, and policymakers aiming to align with the market's evolution.\\nUnderstanding the Assisted Living Market\\nThe assisted living market encompasses a wide range of care options tailored to support seniors who require assistance with daily activities while still maintaining some level of independence. Unlike nursing homes, assisted living facilities offer a more home-like environment, which can significantly enhance residents' quality of life. These facilities often feature private or semi-private apartments, communal dining areas, and various recreational spaces that encourage social interaction among residents, fostering a sense of community and belonging.\\nThe Demand for Assisted Living Facilities\\nThe demand for assisted living facilities is primarily driven by demographic shifts. The aging Baby Boomer population, alongside increasing life expectancy, has led to a growing number of seniors needing some form of assisted living. Studies predict that by 2030, nearly 1 in 5 U.S. residents will be aged 65 or older. This statistic highlights the urgent need for more facilities to cater to this demographic. In addition to the sheer number of seniors, the preferences of this generation are also evolving; many older adults today prioritize autonomy and quality of life, which has led to a surge in demand for personalized care options that respect their individual needs and lifestyles.\\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped perceptions of senior housing, emphasizing safety, health protocols, and the importance of social engagement. Consequently, many families are actively seeking high-quality assisted living options that provide both care and community. Facilities that have adapted to include enhanced health measures, such as telehealth services and outdoor activities, have found themselves more appealing to prospective residents and their families. This shift has also prompted a greater emphasis on mental health support, recognizing that emotional well-being is just as critical as physical health in the aging population.\\nKey Players in the Assisted Living Real Estate Market\\nThe landscape of assisted living facilities is populated by various key players, including large multi-facility operators, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and smaller, independent operators. Some of the well-known names in the industry have established themselves through well-designed facilities and strong reputations. These operators often leverage their experience to create environments that not only meet regulatory standards but also exceed residents' expectations in terms of comfort and care.\\nThese operators often invest significantly in property management and innovation to enhance resident experiences, focusing on comfortable living spaces, gourmet dining options, and engaging activities. Many facilities now incorporate technology to improve care delivery, such as electronic health records and monitoring systems that allow for real-time updates on residents' health statuses. As the market grows, the competition among these players intensifies, pushing them towards higher standards of care and service. Additionally, partnerships with local healthcare providers and community organizations are becoming increasingly common, enabling assisted living facilities to offer a more comprehensive range of services that cater to the holistic needs of their residents, from wellness programs to transportation services for medical appointments. This collaborative approach not only enhances the quality of care but also strengthens community ties, making assisted living a more attractive option for families considering long-term care for their loved ones.\\nCurrent Trends in Assisted Living Real Estate\\nThe assisted living real estate market is currently experiencing a multitude of trends that are shaping how facilities are constructed and operated. Amid an increasing demand for customized care options, these trends indicate a significant shift in the industry.\\nShift Towards Luxury Assisted Living Facilities\\nOne noteworthy trend is the move towards luxury assisted living facilities. As more affluent seniors enter the market, there is a growing demand for high-end amenities, including spacious apartments, gourmet dining, and wellness programs. These luxury facilities often feature resort-style environments that prioritize residents' comfort and lifestyle.\\nThis emphasis on luxury isn't just about aesthetics; it reflects a deeper understanding of the residents' desires for quality and dignity in their living arrangements. As a result, many developers are focusing on creating spaces that feel more like upscale homes than traditional care facilities. Features such as private balconies, landscaped gardens, and personalized concierge services are becoming standard, allowing residents to enjoy a lifestyle that mirrors their previous independent living while still receiving the necessary support.\\nThe Impact of Technology on Assisted Living Facilities\\nTechnology is playing an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the operations of assisted living facilities. Incorporating technology not only improves efficiency but also enhances the quality of care provided. For instance, monitoring systems equipped with wearables and smart devices allow staff to oversee residents’ health in real-time.\\nAdditionally, virtual reality and telehealth services are becoming commonplace, providing residents with social engagement opportunities and remote medical consultations. These technological advancements are not only appealing to potential residents but are also viewed favorably by families who prioritize safety and connectivity. Furthermore, many facilities are investing in user-friendly mobile applications that allow residents and their families to schedule activities, access health records, and communicate with caregivers, thereby fostering a sense of community and involvement in care decisions.\\nMoreover, the integration of artificial intelligence in daily operations is revolutionizing how care is delivered. AI-driven analytics can predict health issues before they become critical, enabling proactive interventions. This not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also reduces the burden on staff, allowing them to focus on providing personalized care. As technology continues to evolve, the landscape of assisted living will likely become even more sophisticated, ensuring that residents receive the best possible support tailored to their individual needs.\\nThe Future of Assisted Living Facilities\\nLooking ahead, the future of assisted living facilities is poised for significant transformation both in strategy and execution. Understanding the anticipated trends will allow stakeholders to be proactive rather than reactive.\\nPredicted Growth in the Assisted Living Sector\\nPredictions suggest substantial growth in the assisted living sector over the next decade. As the Baby Boomer generation continues to age, a compelling need for expanded facilities and services will further drive development in this sector.\\nAnalysts project an increase in both small- and large-scale developments targeting this demographic, with an emphasis on diversifying care offerings to meet varying needs. The future landscape may also include a greater emphasis on integrated care models, where assisted living facilities collaborate closely with healthcare providers to ensure a comprehensive approach to residents' wellbeing.\\nPotential Challenges and Opportunities\\nHowever, this growth is not without challenges. Competition among facilities is fierce, which may lead to price wars and compromised service quality. Moreover, navigating regulatory compliance can be complex and daunting, potentially posing barriers to entry for new market players.\\nConversely, these challenges also present numerous opportunities. Innovations in service delivery, marketing approaches, and facility design can significantly set a facility apart from its competitors. Investors offering unique, targeted services that resonate with seniors’ values could find themselves leading the market.\\nInvestment Opportunities in Assisted Living Real Estate\\nAs the assisted living sector expands, investors are keenly seeking lucrative opportunities within this niche market. Understanding the intricacies of this realm is crucial for maximizing potential returns.\\nWhy Invest in Assisted Living Facilities?\\nInvesting in assisted living facilities offers the potential for substantial returns due to the consistent demand for senior care services. The long-term nature of the investment aligns well with the growing population of seniors, creating a stable market environment for operators.\\nMoreover, the appeal of assisted living as a resilient investment class has increased in light of economic fluctuations. Investors are drawn to the reliability of recurring revenue models derived from monthly fees, which provide a solid financial foundation.\\nRisks and Rewards of Investing in Assisted Living Real Estate\\nHowever, investing in assisted living facilities is not without its risks. Fluctuating regulations, changes in healthcare laws, and market oversaturation can impact profitability. Careful consideration and thorough due diligence are essential before making investment decisions.\\nNonetheless, by aligning with experienced operators and developing facilities that meet market demands, investors can tap into a rewarding avenue within real estate. It is crucial to approach investment with a careful strategy, balancing potential rewards against inherent risks.\\nRegulatory Considerations for Assisted Living Facilities\\nSuccessful operation within the assisted living market requires a thorough understanding of regulatory frameworks that govern the industry. Compliance with these standards is not just a legal obligation but also a cornerstone for resident safety and well-being.\\nUnderstanding Zoning Laws and Regulations\\nZoning laws are critical for the establishment and operation of assisted living facilities. Each locality has specific regulations that dictate where these kinds of facilities can be located, impacting everything from property development to operational licenses. Investors and operators must work closely with legal and planning teams to ensure compliance.\\nAs municipalities grow and evolve, zoning regulations may also change, leading to potential challenges for existing facilities. Staying informed of these changes is essential to maintain operational integrity and community relations.\\nCompliance with Health and Safety Standards\\nIn addition to zoning laws, compliance with health and safety standards is paramount in the assisted living sector. These regulations cover various aspects, including resident care, facility maintenance, and employee training. Organizations that prioritize adherence to these standards not only mitigate risks but also enhance their reputations.\\nRegular training and audits can ensure that facilities maintain compliance while fostering a culture of safety. By setting high operational standards, assisted living facilities can reassure families, attract new residents, and secure a strong position in the competitive market.\\nYour Source For Senior Housing Investments\\nSR-HQ@SRSeniorLiving.com\\nCorporate Office\\n30021 Tomas, Suite 130\\nRancho Santa Margarita, CA 92688\\n(949) 620-6585\\nSoutheast Region\\n2 N.

We can help you plan for your future.\\nGet Started Now\\nWe'll work with you to create a plan that will evolve as your life changes.\\nFinancial planning is a process, and we’re here to guide you through each step of the way to ensure that your plan remains dynamic across all stages of life. The steps that we’ll guide you through in planning for your retirement include…\\n\\n\\nSelect an Investment Strategy There are so many “rules of thumb” and gurus that have simple solutions that seem ready-made for you. However, it is rarely simple, and we find that most retirees need a customized strategy tailored to their individual needs and wants. We can help you allocate your assets and invest your money where it will protect and serve you most effectively. LEARN MORE\\nOptimize Your Tax Plan Generally, people change tax brackets over time, politicians change the tax laws, the IRS issues new guidance, and economic boom and bust periods offer new opportunities and pitfalls. We help our clients weave a tax-efficient strategy into their overall plan and even offer in-house tax preparation. LEARN MORE\\nSet Savings Targets & Asset Allocation\\nHow much money will you need to retire while making sure you have an adequate safety net? Should you pay off your mortgage early, save more for retirement, or put more money into non-retirement investments? We can help you define these goals and make a plan.\\nDevelop an Income Plan\\nHow will you continue to account for your expenses in retirement? You need a diversified retirement income strategy to help guide your planning efforts, and we can work with you to create one.\\nMaximize Your Pension\\nWhether you’re a public employee, school teacher, or have a private pension, this can be one of your largest retirement planning assets and a benefit election that is generally irrevocable. We help our clients to choose the best options to claim, evaluate timing, choose survivorship options and decide on any lump sum election.\\nChoose a Social Security Claiming Strategy\\nWhen is the correct time for you to take your Social Security benefits? There are hundreds of permutations on how to claim benefits and reasons why one may work better for you.\\nCreate a Solid Estate Plan\\nMost people will need a Will, Power of Attorney, Living Will, Healthcare Directive, and maybe a trust. We guide our clients’ estate planning efforts while additionally optimizing those efforts with the larger financial plan. Gold and Silver clients have access to our advanced Everplans service.\\nLEARN MORE\\nUse Benefits Plans to Their Max\\nPeople have more benefits at work than they realize. Using these plans to the max can have significant planning ramifications, and we find that most employees fail to take full advantage of these opportunities. We can help you maximize your benefits, whether it’s by: maximizing contributions to savings plans, funding an HSA, electing deferred compensation, utilizing after-tax contributions to 401(k)/403(b), in-plan Roth conversions, electing life/disability insurance(s), or exploring Association benefits.\\nWe help you address the details so you can focus on what matters most.\\nWe want you to retire with confidence. Regardless of your age or wealth, with a financial plan, you can manage your spending and saving, establish short and long-term financial objectives, stay on track by understanding the financial impact of your decisions, and lay the foundation of the retirement you deserve. We’re determined to help you achieve your retirement goals so that you…\\n\\nKnow When to Retire\\nDeciding when to retire is very important for most individuals because there are consequences if done too early or too late. It is often not easy to re-enter the workforce after retiring too early, and you may lose important seniority, benefits, tenure, etc. Retiring too late could cost important time with loved ones, risk health-related issues, or shorten the time you have to enjoy what you’ve built. We help clients balance safety, security, and quality of life in their retirement planning decisions.\\n\\nNever Fear Running Out of Money\\nWe understand that your goal isn’t to be the richest person in the graveyard, but you should be able to live and give without fear.\\xa0One of the most beneficial side effects of having a financial plan is that it can give you the confidence that you won’t run out of money in retirement, the courage to give more in the short term, and the satisfaction of seeing your gifts make a difference in the long term.\\n\\n\\nLeave as Little to Chance as Possible\\nWith proper planning and preparation, you should be able to retire knowing you’re prepared for most of what life may throw at you. The peace of mind that comes with preparation yields a better quality of life so that you can worry less and spend more time with the ones you love.\\nLet's Start Planning.\\nTalk to an Advisor\\n* Your first meeting is complimentary.

Studies on reversing age have mostly focused on aging mice — not humans — and Popular Science says research on humans will be necessary to see promise in this field.\\nWhich billionaire is trying to reverse aging?\\nWhile not a billionaire, Tech CEO Bryan Johnson is reportedly spending up to US$2 million per year on medical tests and various procedures aimed at reversing his body’s natural aging process. However, longevity experts don’t think he has discovered the proverbial fountain of youth.\\nWhat is the latest anti-aging cell technology?\\nThe latest anti-aging cell therapy uses CAR-T cells, a type of white blood cell that help bolster the immune system. CAR stands for chimeric antigen receptor and researchers believe that they can reprogram these cells to become cancer killers or even reverse cellular aging.\\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published by the Investing News Network in 2017.\\nDon’t forget to follow us @INN_LifeScience for real-time news updates.\\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Melissa Pistilli, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\\nFrom Your Site Articles\\n\\n5 Private Longevity Research Companies (Updated 2024) ›\\nTop 5 Small-cap Biotech Stocks (Updated January 2025) ›\\n10 Top Stem Cell Companies on the NASDAQ ›\\n3 Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment Stocks on the NASDAQ | INN ›\\n5 Gene Therapy Stocks for Investors | INN ›\\n\\nRelated Articles Around the Web\\n\\nAre Longevity Stocks the Next Trillion-Dollar Industry? 3 Anti-Aging ... ›\\nBiotech Stocks: How Alzheimer\\'s, Genetics And AI Could Drive A ... ›\\n\\nNASDAQ:GRAL\\nunited kingdomgenetics stockslongevity stockslongevity investingmassachusettsunited states\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/INN_Resource\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-pistilli-865271a9/\\nmpistilli@investingnews.com\\n\\nThe Beginner’s Guide to Investing in the Resource Sector\\nReady to invest in the resource sector?

Although we are living longer, we still spend half of our lives in poor or moderate health.\\nRecent advances in longevity medicine\\nThe past 20 years have seen an exponential increase in our understanding of how ageing leads to changes at the molecular and cellular levels. Changes in diet and non-strenuous exercise can influence longevity, for instance. Dietary restriction (DR), has been shown to extend the lifespan of numerous organisms, and supplementing with NAD+ precursors can prevent age-related conditions, including muscle dysfunction, skin ageing, and heart inflammation. Several signalling pathways - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)–insulin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) - collectively alter in old age to activate mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cellular senescence.\\nInterestingly, anti-aging activity has already been demonstrated in a variety of FDA-approved drugs, including anti-cancer agents mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin, and the anti-diabetic agent metformin, an AMPK activator (Table 1). In 2019, the US FDA approved the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) Trial, which will test the effect of metformin on age-related chronic diseases in 3,000 participants at 14 leading US research institutes, over six years.\\nSeveral companies are now looking to repurpose these small-molecule drugs and/or develop new and improved versions to target age-related conditions. \\xa0In April 2024, Rubedo Life Sciences completed a $40 million Series A financing round to advance its lead candidate RLS-1496 in chronic atopic dermatitis and to develop its preclinical candidates that selectively target senescent cells in pulmonary diseases. In March 2024, CA-based Aeovian Pharmaceuticals raised $50 million in Series A financing to advance its innovative platform of selective mTORC1 inhibitors, AV078, AV805, and AV505, for anti-ageing diseases. In October 2023, US-based Amplifier Therapeutics secured $33.25 million in private equity to accelerate its R&D programmes. ATX-304, is a small molecule, AMPK, and mitochondrial activator, in Phase 1/2 for cardiometabolic diseases, and the company has partnered with Tornado Therapeutics to develop its next-generation mTOR inhibitors, TOR-101 and TOR-103, in age-related diseases.\\n\\nTable 1: FDA-approved drugs with anti-ageing activity. Source: modified from Alex Zhavoronkov, 2024\\xa0\\n\\nX\\n- Compound inhibits the hallmark of ageing;\\nX\\n- Role in ageing phenotype or lifespan\\nAlex Zhavoronkov, founder & CEO of Insilico Medicine, stated that he “firmly believes that the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs with demonstrated anti-ageing potential represents a highly promising and cost-effective approach to addressing the growing burden of age-related diseases. This approach aligns with Insilico’s dual-purpose target discovery strategy.”\\nAccording to Zhavoronkhov, “AI and specifically DL have become pivotal in identifying novel targets that modulate the hallmarks of ageing. AI excels in analysing vast multi-omics datasets, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to unravel protein interaction networks and the intricate biological processes underlying aging. This capability is crucial for understanding aging-related pathways and hallmarks.” To this end, Insilico Medicine has developed an in-house AI-powered target discovery engine, PandaOmics, incorporating the hallmarks of ageing assessment to identify a list of therapeutic targets specific to age-related diseases.\\nThe company has identified numerous novel targets for anti-ageing, and age-related diseases. For instance, Insilico’s leading drug candidate INS018_055 targets Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), which is not only a novel target against IPF identified by PandaOmics, but also has the potential for metabolic diseases, cancer, and anti-ageing.”\\nLeading academic institutes have also identified several promising age-related targets that may warrant further investigation. In July 2024, researchers at the Duke-NUS Medical School published a study in Nature demonstrating that anti-interleukin-11 (IL-11) protects mice from age-associated pathologies and extends their lifespan. In March 2024, scientists at Stanford University showed that antibody-mediated depletion of aberrant stem cells can help diminish age-associated inflammation and strengthen acquired immune responses. And, in January 2023, Dr David Sinclair and his colleagues published an article in Cell that showed the loss of epigenetic function can accelerate the hallmark of ageing and that “ICE” (inducible changes to the epigenome) can be used to reverse the effects of ageing in mice.\\nInvestment in longevity research\\nOver the last decade, longevity investment has gradually evolved attracting $0.5 billion in financings in 2013 and peaking at $6.2 billion in 2021, according to Longevity. Technology. In September 2021, a consortium of biotech, clinical, and academic institutes launched the Swiss Longevity Science Foundation (LSF) to fund up to $1 billion in early-stage ageing research. Since 2021, numerous start-up companies have attracted private investment and these funds have largely been channelled into the development of reprogramming agents.\\nIn 2021, Rejuvenate Bio completed a $10 million Series A financing and used these funds to develop a pipeline of partial reprogramming agents using the Yamanaka factors, specifically OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK). Its lead programme, RJB-0402, a liver-directed fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) gene therapy preserves cardiac structure and function and the company expects to initiate an investigational new drug (IND) for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy shortly. The cryptocurrency company Coinbase’s co-founder Brian Armstrong and venture capitalist Blake Byers founded NewLimit, an ageing-focused biotech backed by an initial $110 million investment. The company secured a further $40 million in Series A funding to develop its epigenetic reprogramming therapies.\\nIn 2022, Neurotrack attracted $10 million in Series D funding to develop cognitive health programmes. Co-founders Rick Klausner and Hans Bishop launched Altos Labs, an epigenetic reprogramming company with $3 billion in initial financing from investors including Yuri Milner and Jeff Bezos. Retro Biosciences, secured initial funding of $180 million and Turn Biotechnologies raised $2.5 million to use mRNA medicines to focus on tissue reprogramming.\\nIn 2023, UK-based Clook.bio raised $4 million to leverage its human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and CRISPR screen to identify biomarkers and gene candidates to target cellular rejuvenation. Verve Therapeutics completed an IPO and raised $143.8 million. It expanded its collaboration with Eli Lilly to develop VERVE-101, VERVE-102, and VERVE-201, in vivo gene editing programmes targeting PCSK9, ANGPTL3, and LPA, genes that increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD).\\nAnd, in 2024, UK-based Genflow Biosciences raised £715,000 through the placing and subscription for new stock organised by Capital Plus Partners. The company has made significant progress and plans to file an IND for its lead compound, GF-1002, an exo-AAV expressing cDNA of centenarian variant sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It also has GF-1003, GF-1005, and GF-1004 in preclinical development and has established collaborations with EXO Biologics, UCB, and IvexLabs.\\nFuture outlook\\nIn October 2023, researchers from the University of Oslo and, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine published an article in the journal Aging Cell, where they used Insilico Medicine’s PandaOmics (see above) to identify 22 dual-purpose target candidates for anti-ageing and anti-cancer treatment. One candidate, histone demethylase KDM1A, has since been shown to significantly extend lifespan in an ageing research animal model and has anti-cancer activities in clinical studies in colorectal and triple-negative breast cancer.\\nInsilico has also launched PreciousGPT, which employs multimodal transformer-based transfer learning and feature importance analysis to analyse omics data and enhance the discovery of targets that may reverse or accelerate biological age. The company has also built “Life Models”, such as Precious3GPT, a multimodal multiomics, multispecies, multi-tissue, multi-function transformer model that is capable of predicting age and supporting the discovery of new drugs.\\nWhilst longevity research is still in its infancy, the field is wide open for exploration and there are considerable opportunities to develop treatments for age-related diseases through the depletion of senescent cells, stem cell therapy, and antioxidative and anti-inflammatory treatments.\\n“Over the next decade, we can expect the pharmaceutical industry to make significant strides in addressing age-related chronic diseases, which are not inevitably untreatable,” predicts Zhavoronkov.\\nImage\\n\\n\\nCheryl Barton\\n14 August, 2024\\nlongevity\\n\\nBookmark this\\nOncology\\n\\nQuantro Therapeutics and the future of drug discovery: Insig...\\n\\nR&D\\n\\nSponsored\\nExploring the future: Opportunities and challenges in cell a...\\nRare disease treatment poses distinct challenges for physicians, patients, caregivers, and pharma companies.\\nR&D\\n\\nDeep Dive: Research and Development 2025\\nEvery breakthrough in medicine, every new treatment that changes lives, starts with research.\\nR&D\\n\\nLife Sciences Industry Report - Part 7\\nThe importance of biosimilars only continues to grow, driven by the potential savings they are able to deliver to healthcare systems.\\nR&D\\n\\nJennifer Schneider’s insights on immunotherapy at JP Morgan ...\\nJonah Comstock caught up with Jennifer Schneider, CEO of Centauri Therapeutics, in San Francisco in January during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference\\nOncology\\n\\nLife Sciences Industry Report - Part 5\\nDevelopments in the oncology space in 2024 brought hope to both industry and patients.\\nR&D\\n\\nPartner Content\\nReturn to Europe for the 2nd IMPACCT Real World Evidence Sum...\\nThe IMPACCT Real World Evidence Summit is back, offering the opportunity to bring together 50+ pharma RWE decision makers to discuss integrated evidence plans, data sharing optimization, infrastruc\\nR&D\\n\\nPartner Content\\n4th Circular & Self-Amplifying RNA Therapeutics Summit\\nWith CSL Seqirus and Arcturus Therapeutics successfully developing the first approved self-amplifying RNA vaccine, the field of next generation RNAs celebrates the potential of circular and self-am\\nGet in-depth news, opinions and features on pharma and healthcare sent straight to your inbox\\nlongevity\\nageing\\nanti-ageing drugs\\nage-related diseases\\ncell senescence\\nCategory : R&D / Views & Analysis\\n\\nEditor's Picks\\n\\n\\nSynchron, Nvidia showcase AI for brain-computer interfaces\\n\\n\\nSanofi signs $1.9bn deal to buy Dren Bio autoimmune drug\\n\\n\\nUK is becoming an 'outlier' for pharma, hitting investment\\n\\n\\nSofinnova closes new fund and backs a trio of new biotechs\\n\\n\\nAZ builds in China, as J&J ramps up its US investments\\n\\n\\nOncology\\n\\nQuantro Therapeutics and the future of drug discovery: Insig...\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nSponsored\\nHealth Trends 2025: Reimagining What's Possible\\nJoin the conversation, on Tuesday 28th January @ 10 am ET - 3 pm GMT - 4 pm CET, in our webinar sponsored by Syneos Health, entitled ‘Health Trends 2025: Reimagining What's Possibl\\nPharmaphorum Menu\\n\\nDigital\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nMarket Access\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nOncology\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nPatients\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nR&D\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nSpotlight on\\nThe Future of Generics\\nFrontiers Health 2023\\nFrontiers Health 2024\\nLife Science Industry Report\\nWorld Without Disease Summit\\n\\n\\n\\nSign up for email newsletters and Deep Dive\\nSubscribe\\nrss facebook linkedin twitter\\nPharmaphorum\\nAbout us Advertising Contact us\\nContribute Cookie Policy Privacy Policy\\nTerms & Conditions Work for us\\nThe rights of trademark owners are acknowledged.

It will grow to $52.84 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to increasing maternal age, rising demand for same-sex parenting, medical tourism, expanding healthcare infrastructure, research and development. Major trends in the forecast period include use of artificial intelligence (AI), egg freezing, single-embryo transfer (SET), PGT-A and genetic screening, innovative fertility preservation techniques.  \\nThe assisted reproductive technology market is anticipated to experience growth due to the increasing number of infertility cases. Infertility, diagnosed after a year of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, impacts a significant portion of the global adult population, affecting approximately 1 in 6 adults or 17.5% globally, as stated by the World Health Organization in April 2023. As a result, the rising prevalence of infertility cases is propelling the demand for assisted reproductive technology (ART), which encompasses fertility treatments involving both male and female reproductive components.  \\nThe escalating prevalence of obesity is poised to drive the growth of the ART market in the future. The World Heart Federation reported in March 2023 that around 2.3 billion individuals, including adults and children, were affected by obesity or being overweight globally. Projections indicate that by 2025, this number may soar to 2.7 billion, underscoring the significant impact of obesity on fertility and the subsequent demand for specialized ART services.  \\nA prominent trend shaping the ART market is the advancement of technology. Leading companies are actively developing technological solutions to fortify their positions within the industry. Notably, Alife Health introduced the Alife Assist platform in October 2022, an innovative suite of products leveraging data-driven insights and artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) process. This platform, consisting of Stim Assist, Embryo Assist, and Insights, caters to reproductive endocrinologists, embryologists, and clinic administrators, aiding in clinical decision-making, streamlining IVF clinic operations, and optimizing medication dosing, embryo grading, and real-time performance monitoring. The implementation of such technology not only enhances the patient experience but also improves success rates in IVF procedures.  \\nLeading companies in the assisted reproductive technology (ART) sector are spearheading the development of innovative products to gain a competitive edge in the market. For example, in July 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., a renowned US-based biotechnology firm, introduced two pioneering next-generation sequencing-based options specifically crafted to support preimplantation genetic testing-aneuploidy (PGT-A) in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) research. The cutting-edge products, namely the Ion ReproSeq PGT-A Kit and the Ion AmpliSeq Polyploidy Kit, are tailored for use in reproductive health labs. These are the first research-use assays in the field, and they are compatible with the Ion Torrent Genexus Integrated Sequencer, providing a comprehensive workflow from the initial sample to the final result for aneuploidy analysis. PGT-A testing facilitates the identification of chromosomal irregularities in embryo samples, offering researchers invaluable genetic insights to potentially bolster the success rate of future pregnancies and improve the health of future generations. The Genexus Integrated Sequencer streamlines the research process by enabling templating, sequencing, and analysis on a single platform. Additionally, the Ion AmpliSeq Polyploidy Panel kit includes quality control features designed to detect contamination, prevent sample mix-ups, and identify triploidy in embryos.  \\nIn November 2023, CooperCompanies, a US-based medical device firm, acquired Cook Medical\\'s Reproductive Health business for $300 million. The products obtained in this acquisition complement CooperSurgical\\'s current portfolio of medical devices and strengthen the company\\'s position as a leading global provider in the fields of fertility and women\\'s health. Cook Medical is a US-based supplier of assisted reproductive technology.\\nReport Scope\\nMarkets Covered: \\n1) By Diagnosis: Ovulation Testing; Hysterosalpingography; Ovarian Reserve Testing; Genetic Testing\\n2) By Procedure Type: Fresh Non-Donor; Fresh Donor; Frozen Donor; Frozen Non-Donor; Embryo or Egg Banking\\n3) By End-User: Hospitals; Fertility Clinics; Other End-Users  \\nSubsegments: \\n1) By Ovulation Testing: Urine Ovulation Predictor Kits; Saliva Ovulation Test Kits\\n2) By Hysterosalpingography (HSG): X-ray HSG; Sonohysterography (SHG)\\n3) By Ovarian Reserve Testing: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Testing; Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Testing; Antral Follicle Count (AFC) via Ultrasound\\n4) By Genetic Testing: Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT); Carrier Screening Tests; Genetic Compatibility Testing  \\nKey Assisted Reproductive Technology Companies Profiled: Cooper Surgical Inc.; Ferring Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Hamilton Thorne Ltd.; Merck KGaA; Genea Limited  \\nCountries: Australia; Brazil; China; France; Germany; India; Indonesia; Japan; Russia; South Korea; UK; USA; Canada; Italy; Spain  \\nRegions: Asia-Pacific; Western Europe; Eastern Europe; North America; South America; Middle East; Africa  \\nTime Series: Five years historic and ten years forecast.  \\nData: Ratios of market size and growth to related markets, GDP proportions, expenditure per capita.  \\nData Segmentation: Country and regional historic and forecast data, market share of competitors, market segments.  \\nKey Attributes\\nReport AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages200Forecast Period2025-2029Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2025$37.21 BillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029$52.84 BillionCompound Annual Growth Rate9.2%Regions CoveredGlobal\\nThe major companies featured in this Assisted Reproductive Technology market report include:\\n\\nCooper Surgical Inc.\\nFerring Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\\nHamilton Thorne Ltd.\\nMerck KGaA\\nGenea Limited\\nCalifornia Cryobank\\nEuropean Sperm Bank\\nOvaScience Inc.\\nBloom IVF Centre\\nVitrolife AB\\nFUJIFILM Irvine Scientific Inc.\\nNidacon International AB\\nMonash IVF Group Ltd.\\nCook Medical\\nINVO Bioscience Inc.\\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\\nBoston Scientific Corporation\\nAnecova Sa\\nCarolinas Fertility Institute\\nMicrom Ltd.\\nInception Sciences Inc.\\nProgyny Inc.\\nOxford Gene Technology IP Ltd.\\nIVI-RMA Global\\nBoston IVF\\nCARE Fertility Group\\nVirtus Health\\nReproductive Medicine Associates of New York\\nShady Grove Fertility\\nCCRM Fertility\\nNew Hope Fertility Center\\nHouston Fertility Institute\\nPacific Fertility Center\\nRMA of New Jersey\\nSher Fertility Institute\\nIVF Florida\\nORM Fertility\\nHRC Fertility\\nArizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility\\nSan Diego Fertility Center\\nFertility Centers of Illinois\\n\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/icwq3x\\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world\\'s leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Reproductive Technology Market size was valued at around USD 34.7 billion in 2023 and is estimated to grow at 6.9% CAGR from 2024 to 2032. Assisted reproductive technology refers to a medical treatment procedure that addresses infertility problems. It includes in-vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. Increasing success rates of these procedures has offered more effective care solutions in hospitals, fertility clinics and surgical centers.\\n\\nThe rising prevalence of infertility across the population base serves as a significant driver for the ART market. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2023, around 17.5% of the adult population – roughly 1 in 6 worldwide experience infertility, showing the urgent need to increase access to affordable, high-quality fertility care for those in need. Further, as per the same report, lifetime infertility prevalence was 17.8% for high-income countries and 16.5% for low- and middle-income countries. As fertility rates decline globally, individuals and couples are increasingly turning to ART services to overcome infertility challenges and achieve their family-building goals.\\nFurthermore, increasing shift towards infertility treatment devices, rising adoption of infertility drugs, advancement in mother care products, rising healthcare expenditure globally, government initiatives and funding, and increasing education & awareness, are the increasing factors nurturing the growth of the market.\\nAssisted Reproductive Technology Market Trends\\nWith the evolution of societal attitudes and the growing acceptance of ART, there is a rising trend among individuals and couples to utilize these advanced reproductive technologies to surmount infertility challenges and achieve their aspirations of parenthood.\\n\\nOver time, societal norms and values regarding family formation, parenthood, and reproductive options have evolved. There is greater acceptance and recognition of diverse family structures, including single-parent families, same-sex couples, and individuals pursuing parenthood independently.\\n\\nFor instance, according to the Department of Health, State Government of Victoria, Australia, in 2024, single-male-parent families are the fastest growing family, increasing between 44% to 65% by 2041. As per the same report, single-female-parent families are projected to make up 13% to 14% of all families in 2041.\\n\\nFurther as per the recent statistics, in the 1950s, less than 10% of families with children were single parent, whereas in 2022, among families with children, 31% were single-parent — more than three times as common.\\n\\nIncreased cultural and religious acceptance of ART, coupled with a desire to adhere to cultural and religious values while addressing infertility, and utilizing fertility testing devices, leading to greater utilization of ART services among diverse populations, thereby stimulating the growth of the market.\\n\\n\\nART Market Analysis\\n\\nBased on type, the market is bifurcated into product and procedure. The procedure segment is estimated to account for USD 58.6 billion by 2032.\\n\\nThe prevalence of infertility is increasing globally due to various factors such as lifestyle changes, environmental factors, and delaying childbirth. As a result, more individuals and couples are seeking fertility treatments, fertility supplements, and adopting ART procedures, to achieve their goal of parenthood.\\n\\nIt encompasses various assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and artificial insemination. Increasing number of in-vitro fertilization increases the adoption rate of assisted reproductive technology.\\n\\nFor instance, according to the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in 2021, the number of children born through in vitro fertilization as part of infertility treatment increased by 9,416 from the previous year to a record high of 69,797 in Japan. Furthermore, the most common age for those receiving treatment was 39, with 39,631 cases, followed by those aged 40 and 41.\\n\\nContinuous advancements in ART technologies and techniques have significantly improved success rates and outcomes of procedures. Innovations such as time-lapse imaging, preimplantation genetic testing, and embryo vitrification have enhanced the efficacy and safety of ART procedures, leading to increased adoption and demand.\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on end-user/provider, the assisted reproductive technology market is divided into hospitals, fertility clinics, and other end-users/providers. The fertility clinics segment accounted for USD 18.8 billion in 2023.\\n\\nThese clinics are dedicated to reproductive medicine and have specialized expertise in diagnosing and treating infertility. They employ reproductive endocrinologists, fertility specialists, embryologists, and other healthcare professionals who are trained and experienced in ART procedures.\\n\\nIncrease in fertility clinics is a significant driver for the market leading to increased uptake of ART among the patients.\\n\\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, in 2023, India is witnessing a surge in IVF clinics and chains, with an estimated 2500 clinics functional across India.\\n\\nFurther, according to the National Library of Medicine, in 2021, a total of 601 fertility clinics in Japan performed treatments of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Thus, such aforementioned factors are expected to augment the segmental growth.\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. assisted reproductive technology market is anticipated to grow at CAGR of 6.5% during the analysis timeframe.\\n\\nIncreasing percentage of IVF delivery rate/cycle in the US further attracts a major pool of patients to adopt the ART procedures, thereby escalating the growth of the market.\\n\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2021, 86,146 infants born (or 2.3% of all infants born in the U.S.) were conceived through the use of ART in the U.S. IVF enables individuals who use fertility preservation services to save their eggs, sperm, or reproductive tissues to have children at a later time.\\n\\n\\nGermany assisted reproductive technology (ART) market is anticipated to witness lucrative growth between 2024 – 2032.\\n\\nThe country has witnessed a growing demand for ART services due to factors such as delayed childbearing, rising infertility rates, and increased awareness about assisted reproductive technologies.\\n\\nThe trend of postponing parenting for career goals and financial stability has led to an increased reliance on ART services in the country.\\n\\n\\nJapan assisted reproductive technology market is expected to grow significantly over the years.\\n\\nJapan is known for its technological innovation across various industries, including healthcare. Japanese companies have developed advanced ART technologies and equipment, making them a preferred choice for patients seeking fertility treatments.\\n\\nSimilar to many developed countries, Japan has an aging population and declining birth rates. This demographic trend has led to an increase in demand for ART services among couples facing infertility issues or delaying parenthood.\\n\\n\\nSouth Africa ART market is anticipated to witness lucrative growth between 2024 – 2032.\\n\\nSouth Africa government has implemented regulations to govern the practice of ART and ensure the safety and quality of fertility treatments.

But a new global ranking by TIME and Statista of the 250 top EdTech companies suggests that online learning is here to stay.\\nNine of the top 15 most successful EdTech companies in the world are focused on providing online learning. The rankings are based on a formula evaluating financial strength and industry impact.\\nEruditus, the top EdTech company in the global rankings, reported a revenue of close to $400 million for the financial year ending in June 2023, up 75% over the prior year. The EdTech platform offers online courses from more than 80 universities around the world, including business schools at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Cambridge, and MIT. Eruditus says it has so far educated more than 500,000 people across 80 countries.\\nEruditus was incorporated in Singapore but made news this year for reportedly shifting its headquarters to India. “It is a fact that the Indian stock markets are far more attractive than the global peers,\" co-founder and CEO Ashwin Damera told Indian news-outlet Mint in January.\\nThe U.S. dominates the list, making up more than one-third of the slots. China trails behind with 10% and the U.K. has just over 6%. Two companies from Brazil also made it into the top 10: Afya runs medical schools and offers online classes in various health fields; Vitru Education provides online and on-campus classes in Brazil to, the company reports, more than 900,000 undergraduate and graduate students.\\nBrazil’s EdTech market has been growing rapidly for years. The country has struggled with education. In Brazil, just 57% of adults aged 25 to 64 have completed upper secondary education, much lower than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country average of 79%, putting it nearly last among the 41 countries studied by the OECD for educational attainment. And the OECD\\'s 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranked Brazil 40 of 41 countries studied for students’ skills in reading, math, and sciences. The private sector has capitalized on the opportunity to offer online learning.\\n“Students that are older, that have worked for a bit, have some kind of education qualification but are upgrading so they can get a better job, they value convenience and affordability,” says Jitin Sethi, managing director at LEK Consulting, focused on education in the Americas. “That creates a unique opportunity to innovate.”\\nIn addition to highlighting 250 top EdTech companies, Statista and TIME also published a Rising Stars ranking to spotlight organizations that had the highest revenue growth rates over the last three years, of companies that submitted applications. Scaler Academy, an online learning platform based in India that teaches coding, system design, and career development skills, topped that list. —Sanya Mansoor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHome\\nU.S.\\nPolitics\\nWorld\\nHealth\\nBusiness\\nTech\\nPersonal Finance by TIME Stamped\\nShopping by TIME Stamped\\n\\nFuture of Work by Charter\\n\\n\\nEntertainment\\n\\nIdeas\\nScience\\nHistory\\nSports\\nMagazine\\nThe TIME Vault\\nTIME For Kids\\nTIMECO2\\n\\nCoupons\\n\\n\\nTIME Edge\\n\\nVideo\\nMasthead\\nNewsletters\\nSubscribe\\nDigital Magazine\\nGive a Gift\\nShop the TIME Store\\nCareers\\n\\nModern Slavery Statement\\n\\n\\nPress Room\\n\\nTIME Studios\\nU.S. & Canada Customer Care\\nGlobal Help Center\\nContact the Editors\\nReprints and Permissions\\nSite Map\\nMedia Kit\\nSupplied Partner Content\\nAbout Us\\n\\n© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

This article delves into the current trends, challenges, and future foresight regarding real estate in the assisted living sector. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors, operators, and policymakers aiming to align with the market's evolution.\\nUnderstanding the Assisted Living Market\\nThe assisted living market encompasses a wide range of care options tailored to support seniors who require assistance with daily activities while still maintaining some level of independence. Unlike nursing homes, assisted living facilities offer a more home-like environment, which can significantly enhance residents' quality of life. These facilities often feature private or semi-private apartments, communal dining areas, and various recreational spaces that encourage social interaction among residents, fostering a sense of community and belonging.\\nThe Demand for Assisted Living Facilities\\nThe demand for assisted living facilities is primarily driven by demographic shifts. The aging Baby Boomer population, alongside increasing life expectancy, has led to a growing number of seniors needing some form of assisted living. Studies predict that by 2030, nearly 1 in 5 U.S. residents will be aged 65 or older. This statistic highlights the urgent need for more facilities to cater to this demographic. In addition to the sheer number of seniors, the preferences of this generation are also evolving; many older adults today prioritize autonomy and quality of life, which has led to a surge in demand for personalized care options that respect their individual needs and lifestyles.\\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped perceptions of senior housing, emphasizing safety, health protocols, and the importance of social engagement. Consequently, many families are actively seeking high-quality assisted living options that provide both care and community. Facilities that have adapted to include enhanced health measures, such as telehealth services and outdoor activities, have found themselves more appealing to prospective residents and their families. This shift has also prompted a greater emphasis on mental health support, recognizing that emotional well-being is just as critical as physical health in the aging population.\\nKey Players in the Assisted Living Real Estate Market\\nThe landscape of assisted living facilities is populated by various key players, including large multi-facility operators, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and smaller, independent operators. Some of the well-known names in the industry have established themselves through well-designed facilities and strong reputations. These operators often leverage their experience to create environments that not only meet regulatory standards but also exceed residents' expectations in terms of comfort and care.\\nThese operators often invest significantly in property management and innovation to enhance resident experiences, focusing on comfortable living spaces, gourmet dining options, and engaging activities. Many facilities now incorporate technology to improve care delivery, such as electronic health records and monitoring systems that allow for real-time updates on residents' health statuses. As the market grows, the competition among these players intensifies, pushing them towards higher standards of care and service. Additionally, partnerships with local healthcare providers and community organizations are becoming increasingly common, enabling assisted living facilities to offer a more comprehensive range of services that cater to the holistic needs of their residents, from wellness programs to transportation services for medical appointments. This collaborative approach not only enhances the quality of care but also strengthens community ties, making assisted living a more attractive option for families considering long-term care for their loved ones.\\nCurrent Trends in Assisted Living Real Estate\\nThe assisted living real estate market is currently experiencing a multitude of trends that are shaping how facilities are constructed and operated. Amid an increasing demand for customized care options, these trends indicate a significant shift in the industry.\\nShift Towards Luxury Assisted Living Facilities\\nOne noteworthy trend is the move towards luxury assisted living facilities. As more affluent seniors enter the market, there is a growing demand for high-end amenities, including spacious apartments, gourmet dining, and wellness programs. These luxury facilities often feature resort-style environments that prioritize residents' comfort and lifestyle.\\nThis emphasis on luxury isn't just about aesthetics; it reflects a deeper understanding of the residents' desires for quality and dignity in their living arrangements. As a result, many developers are focusing on creating spaces that feel more like upscale homes than traditional care facilities. Features such as private balconies, landscaped gardens, and personalized concierge services are becoming standard, allowing residents to enjoy a lifestyle that mirrors their previous independent living while still receiving the necessary support.\\nThe Impact of Technology on Assisted Living Facilities\\nTechnology is playing an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the operations of assisted living facilities. Incorporating technology not only improves efficiency but also enhances the quality of care provided. For instance, monitoring systems equipped with wearables and smart devices allow staff to oversee residents’ health in real-time.\\nAdditionally, virtual reality and telehealth services are becoming commonplace, providing residents with social engagement opportunities and remote medical consultations. These technological advancements are not only appealing to potential residents but are also viewed favorably by families who prioritize safety and connectivity. Furthermore, many facilities are investing in user-friendly mobile applications that allow residents and their families to schedule activities, access health records, and communicate with caregivers, thereby fostering a sense of community and involvement in care decisions.\\nMoreover, the integration of artificial intelligence in daily operations is revolutionizing how care is delivered. AI-driven analytics can predict health issues before they become critical, enabling proactive interventions. This not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also reduces the burden on staff, allowing them to focus on providing personalized care. As technology continues to evolve, the landscape of assisted living will likely become even more sophisticated, ensuring that residents receive the best possible support tailored to their individual needs.\\nThe Future of Assisted Living Facilities\\nLooking ahead, the future of assisted living facilities is poised for significant transformation both in strategy and execution. Understanding the anticipated trends will allow stakeholders to be proactive rather than reactive.\\nPredicted Growth in the Assisted Living Sector\\nPredictions suggest substantial growth in the assisted living sector over the next decade. As the Baby Boomer generation continues to age, a compelling need for expanded facilities and services will further drive development in this sector.\\nAnalysts project an increase in both small- and large-scale developments targeting this demographic, with an emphasis on diversifying care offerings to meet varying needs. The future landscape may also include a greater emphasis on integrated care models, where assisted living facilities collaborate closely with healthcare providers to ensure a comprehensive approach to residents' wellbeing.\\nPotential Challenges and Opportunities\\nHowever, this growth is not without challenges. Competition among facilities is fierce, which may lead to price wars and compromised service quality. Moreover, navigating regulatory compliance can be complex and daunting, potentially posing barriers to entry for new market players.\\nConversely, these challenges also present numerous opportunities. Innovations in service delivery, marketing approaches, and facility design can significantly set a facility apart from its competitors. Investors offering unique, targeted services that resonate with seniors’ values could find themselves leading the market.\\nInvestment Opportunities in Assisted Living Real Estate\\nAs the assisted living sector expands, investors are keenly seeking lucrative opportunities within this niche market. Understanding the intricacies of this realm is crucial for maximizing potential returns.\\nWhy Invest in Assisted Living Facilities?\\nInvesting in assisted living facilities offers the potential for substantial returns due to the consistent demand for senior care services. The long-term nature of the investment aligns well with the growing population of seniors, creating a stable market environment for operators.\\nMoreover, the appeal of assisted living as a resilient investment class has increased in light of economic fluctuations. Investors are drawn to the reliability of recurring revenue models derived from monthly fees, which provide a solid financial foundation.\\nRisks and Rewards of Investing in Assisted Living Real Estate\\nHowever, investing in assisted living facilities is not without its risks. Fluctuating regulations, changes in healthcare laws, and market oversaturation can impact profitability. Careful consideration and thorough due diligence are essential before making investment decisions.\\nNonetheless, by aligning with experienced operators and developing facilities that meet market demands, investors can tap into a rewarding avenue within real estate. It is crucial to approach investment with a careful strategy, balancing potential rewards against inherent risks.\\nRegulatory Considerations for Assisted Living Facilities\\nSuccessful operation within the assisted living market requires a thorough understanding of regulatory frameworks that govern the industry. Compliance with these standards is not just a legal obligation but also a cornerstone for resident safety and well-being.\\nUnderstanding Zoning Laws and Regulations\\nZoning laws are critical for the establishment and operation of assisted living facilities. Each locality has specific regulations that dictate where these kinds of facilities can be located, impacting everything from property development to operational licenses. Investors and operators must work closely with legal and planning teams to ensure compliance.\\nAs municipalities grow and evolve, zoning regulations may also change, leading to potential challenges for existing facilities. Staying informed of these changes is essential to maintain operational integrity and community relations.\\nCompliance with Health and Safety Standards\\nIn addition to zoning laws, compliance with health and safety standards is paramount in the assisted living sector. These regulations cover various aspects, including resident care, facility maintenance, and employee training. Organizations that prioritize adherence to these standards not only mitigate risks but also enhance their reputations.\\nRegular training and audits can ensure that facilities maintain compliance while fostering a culture of safety. By setting high operational standards, assisted living facilities can reassure families, attract new residents, and secure a strong position in the competitive market.\\nYour Source For Senior Housing Investments\\nSR-HQ@SRSeniorLiving.com\\nCorporate Office\\n30021 Tomas, Suite 130\\nRancho Santa Margarita, CA 92688\\n(949) 620-6585\\nSoutheast Region\\n2 N.

We can help you plan for your future.\\nGet Started Now\\nWe'll work with you to create a plan that will evolve as your life changes.\\nFinancial planning is a process, and we’re here to guide you through each step of the way to ensure that your plan remains dynamic across all stages of life. The steps that we’ll guide you through in planning for your retirement include…\\n\\n\\nSelect an Investment Strategy There are so many “rules of thumb” and gurus that have simple solutions that seem ready-made for you. However, it is rarely simple, and we find that most retirees need a customized strategy tailored to their individual needs and wants. We can help you allocate your assets and invest your money where it will protect and serve you most effectively. LEARN MORE\\nOptimize Your Tax Plan Generally, people change tax brackets over time, politicians change the tax laws, the IRS issues new guidance, and economic boom and bust periods offer new opportunities and pitfalls. We help our clients weave a tax-efficient strategy into their overall plan and even offer in-house tax preparation. LEARN MORE\\nSet Savings Targets & Asset Allocation\\nHow much money will you need to retire while making sure you have an adequate safety net? Should you pay off your mortgage early, save more for retirement, or put more money into non-retirement investments? We can help you define these goals and make a plan.\\nDevelop an Income Plan\\nHow will you continue to account for your expenses in retirement? You need a diversified retirement income strategy to help guide your planning efforts, and we can work with you to create one.\\nMaximize Your Pension\\nWhether you’re a public employee, school teacher, or have a private pension, this can be one of your largest retirement planning assets and a benefit election that is generally irrevocable. We help our clients to choose the best options to claim, evaluate timing, choose survivorship options and decide on any lump sum election.\\nChoose a Social Security Claiming Strategy\\nWhen is the correct time for you to take your Social Security benefits? There are hundreds of permutations on how to claim benefits and reasons why one may work better for you.\\nCreate a Solid Estate Plan\\nMost people will need a Will, Power of Attorney, Living Will, Healthcare Directive, and maybe a trust. We guide our clients’ estate planning efforts while additionally optimizing those efforts with the larger financial plan. Gold and Silver clients have access to our advanced Everplans service.\\nLEARN MORE\\nUse Benefits Plans to Their Max\\nPeople have more benefits at work than they realize. Using these plans to the max can have significant planning ramifications, and we find that most employees fail to take full advantage of these opportunities. We can help you maximize your benefits, whether it’s by: maximizing contributions to savings plans, funding an HSA, electing deferred compensation, utilizing after-tax contributions to 401(k)/403(b), in-plan Roth conversions, electing life/disability insurance(s), or exploring Association benefits.\\nWe help you address the details so you can focus on what matters most.\\nWe want you to retire with confidence. Regardless of your age or wealth, with a financial plan, you can manage your spending and saving, establish short and long-term financial objectives, stay on track by understanding the financial impact of your decisions, and lay the foundation of the retirement you deserve. We’re determined to help you achieve your retirement goals so that you…\\n\\nKnow When to Retire\\nDeciding when to retire is very important for most individuals because there are consequences if done too early or too late. It is often not easy to re-enter the workforce after retiring too early, and you may lose important seniority, benefits, tenure, etc. Retiring too late could cost important time with loved ones, risk health-related issues, or shorten the time you have to enjoy what you’ve built. We help clients balance safety, security, and quality of life in their retirement planning decisions.\\n\\nNever Fear Running Out of Money\\nWe understand that your goal isn’t to be the richest person in the graveyard, but you should be able to live and give without fear.\\xa0One of the most beneficial side effects of having a financial plan is that it can give you the confidence that you won’t run out of money in retirement, the courage to give more in the short term, and the satisfaction of seeing your gifts make a difference in the long term.\\n\\n\\nLeave as Little to Chance as Possible\\nWith proper planning and preparation, you should be able to retire knowing you’re prepared for most of what life may throw at you. The peace of mind that comes with preparation yields a better quality of life so that you can worry less and spend more time with the ones you love.\\nLet's Start Planning.\\nTalk to an Advisor\\n* Your first meeting is complimentary.

We consider taxes in all our advice.\\nInvestments\\nMost advisors favor complexity to validate high fees. We believe good investments are broadly diversified, low-cost, and tax-efficient. If you can’t understand it, then it’s probably not a good investment.\\nCharitable Giving\\nOur clients often give money to good causes. Our flat fee model may save you more money to give more to those you care about.\\nRetirement\\nWe’ll help you get on track and stay on track. Retirement should be a point of inspiration, and we’ll help you live it to the fullest.\\nEstate + Inheritance\\nWe want your wishes to be carried out and to minimize the current estate tax rate. It all starts with gaining a deep understanding of what’s important to you and putting the appropriate plan in place.\\nInsurance\\nWe don’t sell it, that would be an obvious conflict of interest. But we do guide you to the right products, and away from the wrong ones.\\nControl Your Financial Security\\nYou are successful and want to preserve and grow what you have built. Work with an advisor who will help guide you to successfully meet your goals.

From ancient myths about the Fountain of Youth to modern advancements in anti aging technology, the drive to extend lifespan and healthspan has never been more promising. Thanks to breakthroughs in biotechnology aging, we are now witnessing the emergence of solutions that not only address the symptoms of aging but also target its root causes.\\nIn the past decade, the longevity biotech space has transformed from a niche scientific endeavor to a thriving industry with massive potential. Longevity companies are now developing therapies that focus on reversing cellular damage, improving mitochondrial function, and removing senescent cells—all of which are critical to slowing down or even halting the aging process. As a result, this sector has attracted billions in funding from governments, venture capital firms, and individual investors, with longevity stocks becoming an increasingly attractive asset class.\\nThe longevity market, estimated at $600 billion by 2025, encompasses not only longevity biotech firms but also longevity startups, regenerative medicine providers, and AI-driven drug discovery platforms. These companies are pioneering new approaches to enhance life expectancy while maintaining a high quality of life. Their work spans diverse areas, including longevity drugs, organ regeneration, age reversal unity therapies, and the development of cutting-edge longevity treatments.\\nMore than just extending lifespan, these innovations aim to redefine what aging means. Instead of accepting the physical and cognitive decline that comes with aging, longevity tech seeks to usher in a future where aging is seen as a treatable condition. By addressing the underlying biological pathways of aging, these technologies promise to delay the onset of age-related diseases like Alzheimer\\'s, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders, allowing people to enjoy extended years of vitality and productivity.\\n\\u200d\\n\\n\\u200d\\nTop Longevity Biotech Companies\\nHere are some of the most innovative longevity biotechs in the world:\\n\\u200d\\n1. \\u200d\\u200dAltos Labs\\nCOO: Ann Lee-Karlon\\nLocation: California, USA\\nFounded in 2021 and backed by Jeff Bezos, Altos Labs focuses on cellular rejuvenation. Using Yamanaka factors, the company aims to reprogram cells to a youthful state, reversing signs of aging. By 2025, Altos Labs has initiated human clinical trials targeting neurodegenerative and immune-related aging disorders, positioning itself as a leading longevity startup in the world.\\n\\u200d\\u200d\\n2.

Studies on reversing age have mostly focused on aging mice — not humans — and Popular Science says research on humans will be necessary to see promise in this field.\\nWhich billionaire is trying to reverse aging?\\nWhile not a billionaire, Tech CEO Bryan Johnson is reportedly spending up to US$2 million per year on medical tests and various procedures aimed at reversing his body’s natural aging process. However, longevity experts don’t think he has discovered the proverbial fountain of youth.\\nWhat is the latest anti-aging cell technology?\\nThe latest anti-aging cell therapy uses CAR-T cells, a type of white blood cell that help bolster the immune system. CAR stands for chimeric antigen receptor and researchers believe that they can reprogram these cells to become cancer killers or even reverse cellular aging.\\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published by the Investing News Network in 2017.\\nDon’t forget to follow us @INN_LifeScience for real-time news updates.\\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Melissa Pistilli, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\\nFrom Your Site Articles\\n\\n5 Private Longevity Research Companies (Updated 2024) ›\\nTop 5 Small-cap Biotech Stocks (Updated January 2025) ›\\n10 Top Stem Cell Companies on the NASDAQ ›\\n3 Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment Stocks on the NASDAQ | INN ›\\n5 Gene Therapy Stocks for Investors | INN ›\\n\\nRelated Articles Around the Web\\n\\nAre Longevity Stocks the Next Trillion-Dollar Industry? 3 Anti-Aging ... ›\\nBiotech Stocks: How Alzheimer\\'s, Genetics And AI Could Drive A ... ›\\n\\nNASDAQ:GRAL\\nunited kingdomgenetics stockslongevity stockslongevity investingmassachusettsunited states\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/INN_Resource\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-pistilli-865271a9/\\nmpistilli@investingnews.com\\n\\nThe Beginner’s Guide to Investing in the Resource Sector\\nReady to invest in the resource sector?

Although we are living longer, we still spend half of our lives in poor or moderate health.\\nRecent advances in longevity medicine\\nThe past 20 years have seen an exponential increase in our understanding of how ageing leads to changes at the molecular and cellular levels. Changes in diet and non-strenuous exercise can influence longevity, for instance. Dietary restriction (DR), has been shown to extend the lifespan of numerous organisms, and supplementing with NAD+ precursors can prevent age-related conditions, including muscle dysfunction, skin ageing, and heart inflammation. Several signalling pathways - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)–insulin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) - collectively alter in old age to activate mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cellular senescence.\\nInterestingly, anti-aging activity has already been demonstrated in a variety of FDA-approved drugs, including anti-cancer agents mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin, and the anti-diabetic agent metformin, an AMPK activator (Table 1). In 2019, the US FDA approved the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) Trial, which will test the effect of metformin on age-related chronic diseases in 3,000 participants at 14 leading US research institutes, over six years.\\nSeveral companies are now looking to repurpose these small-molecule drugs and/or develop new and improved versions to target age-related conditions. \\xa0In April 2024, Rubedo Life Sciences completed a $40 million Series A financing round to advance its lead candidate RLS-1496 in chronic atopic dermatitis and to develop its preclinical candidates that selectively target senescent cells in pulmonary diseases. In March 2024, CA-based Aeovian Pharmaceuticals raised $50 million in Series A financing to advance its innovative platform of selective mTORC1 inhibitors, AV078, AV805, and AV505, for anti-ageing diseases. In October 2023, US-based Amplifier Therapeutics secured $33.25 million in private equity to accelerate its R&D programmes. ATX-304, is a small molecule, AMPK, and mitochondrial activator, in Phase 1/2 for cardiometabolic diseases, and the company has partnered with Tornado Therapeutics to develop its next-generation mTOR inhibitors, TOR-101 and TOR-103, in age-related diseases.\\n\\nTable 1: FDA-approved drugs with anti-ageing activity. Source: modified from Alex Zhavoronkov, 2024\\xa0\\n\\nX\\n- Compound inhibits the hallmark of ageing;\\nX\\n- Role in ageing phenotype or lifespan\\nAlex Zhavoronkov, founder & CEO of Insilico Medicine, stated that he “firmly believes that the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs with demonstrated anti-ageing potential represents a highly promising and cost-effective approach to addressing the growing burden of age-related diseases. This approach aligns with Insilico’s dual-purpose target discovery strategy.”\\nAccording to Zhavoronkhov, “AI and specifically DL have become pivotal in identifying novel targets that modulate the hallmarks of ageing. AI excels in analysing vast multi-omics datasets, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to unravel protein interaction networks and the intricate biological processes underlying aging. This capability is crucial for understanding aging-related pathways and hallmarks.” To this end, Insilico Medicine has developed an in-house AI-powered target discovery engine, PandaOmics, incorporating the hallmarks of ageing assessment to identify a list of therapeutic targets specific to age-related diseases.\\nThe company has identified numerous novel targets for anti-ageing, and age-related diseases. For instance, Insilico’s leading drug candidate INS018_055 targets Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), which is not only a novel target against IPF identified by PandaOmics, but also has the potential for metabolic diseases, cancer, and anti-ageing.”\\nLeading academic institutes have also identified several promising age-related targets that may warrant further investigation. In July 2024, researchers at the Duke-NUS Medical School published a study in Nature demonstrating that anti-interleukin-11 (IL-11) protects mice from age-associated pathologies and extends their lifespan. In March 2024, scientists at Stanford University showed that antibody-mediated depletion of aberrant stem cells can help diminish age-associated inflammation and strengthen acquired immune responses. And, in January 2023, Dr David Sinclair and his colleagues published an article in Cell that showed the loss of epigenetic function can accelerate the hallmark of ageing and that “ICE” (inducible changes to the epigenome) can be used to reverse the effects of ageing in mice.\\nInvestment in longevity research\\nOver the last decade, longevity investment has gradually evolved attracting $0.5 billion in financings in 2013 and peaking at $6.2 billion in 2021, according to Longevity. Technology. In September 2021, a consortium of biotech, clinical, and academic institutes launched the Swiss Longevity Science Foundation (LSF) to fund up to $1 billion in early-stage ageing research. Since 2021, numerous start-up companies have attracted private investment and these funds have largely been channelled into the development of reprogramming agents.\\nIn 2021, Rejuvenate Bio completed a $10 million Series A financing and used these funds to develop a pipeline of partial reprogramming agents using the Yamanaka factors, specifically OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK). Its lead programme, RJB-0402, a liver-directed fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) gene therapy preserves cardiac structure and function and the company expects to initiate an investigational new drug (IND) for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy shortly. The cryptocurrency company Coinbase’s co-founder Brian Armstrong and venture capitalist Blake Byers founded NewLimit, an ageing-focused biotech backed by an initial $110 million investment. The company secured a further $40 million in Series A funding to develop its epigenetic reprogramming therapies.\\nIn 2022, Neurotrack attracted $10 million in Series D funding to develop cognitive health programmes. Co-founders Rick Klausner and Hans Bishop launched Altos Labs, an epigenetic reprogramming company with $3 billion in initial financing from investors including Yuri Milner and Jeff Bezos. Retro Biosciences, secured initial funding of $180 million and Turn Biotechnologies raised $2.5 million to use mRNA medicines to focus on tissue reprogramming.\\nIn 2023, UK-based Clook.bio raised $4 million to leverage its human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and CRISPR screen to identify biomarkers and gene candidates to target cellular rejuvenation. Verve Therapeutics completed an IPO and raised $143.8 million. It expanded its collaboration with Eli Lilly to develop VERVE-101, VERVE-102, and VERVE-201, in vivo gene editing programmes targeting PCSK9, ANGPTL3, and LPA, genes that increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD).\\nAnd, in 2024, UK-based Genflow Biosciences raised £715,000 through the placing and subscription for new stock organised by Capital Plus Partners. The company has made significant progress and plans to file an IND for its lead compound, GF-1002, an exo-AAV expressing cDNA of centenarian variant sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It also has GF-1003, GF-1005, and GF-1004 in preclinical development and has established collaborations with EXO Biologics, UCB, and IvexLabs.\\nFuture outlook\\nIn October 2023, researchers from the University of Oslo and, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine published an article in the journal Aging Cell, where they used Insilico Medicine’s PandaOmics (see above) to identify 22 dual-purpose target candidates for anti-ageing and anti-cancer treatment. One candidate, histone demethylase KDM1A, has since been shown to significantly extend lifespan in an ageing research animal model and has anti-cancer activities in clinical studies in colorectal and triple-negative breast cancer.\\nInsilico has also launched PreciousGPT, which employs multimodal transformer-based transfer learning and feature importance analysis to analyse omics data and enhance the discovery of targets that may reverse or accelerate biological age. The company has also built “Life Models”, such as Precious3GPT, a multimodal multiomics, multispecies, multi-tissue, multi-function transformer model that is capable of predicting age and supporting the discovery of new drugs.\\nWhilst longevity research is still in its infancy, the field is wide open for exploration and there are considerable opportunities to develop treatments for age-related diseases through the depletion of senescent cells, stem cell therapy, and antioxidative and anti-inflammatory treatments.\\n“Over the next decade, we can expect the pharmaceutical industry to make significant strides in addressing age-related chronic diseases, which are not inevitably untreatable,” predicts Zhavoronkov.\\nImage\\n\\n\\nCheryl Barton\\n14 August, 2024\\nlongevity\\n\\nBookmark this\\nOncology\\n\\nQuantro Therapeutics and the future of drug discovery: Insig...\\n\\nR&D\\n\\nSponsored\\nExploring the future: Opportunities and challenges in cell a...\\nRare disease treatment poses distinct challenges for physicians, patients, caregivers, and pharma companies.\\nR&D\\n\\nDeep Dive: Research and Development 2025\\nEvery breakthrough in medicine, every new treatment that changes lives, starts with research.\\nR&D\\n\\nLife Sciences Industry Report - Part 7\\nThe importance of biosimilars only continues to grow, driven by the potential savings they are able to deliver to healthcare systems.\\nR&D\\n\\nJennifer Schneider’s insights on immunotherapy at JP Morgan ...\\nJonah Comstock caught up with Jennifer Schneider, CEO of Centauri Therapeutics, in San Francisco in January during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference\\nOncology\\n\\nLife Sciences Industry Report - Part 5\\nDevelopments in the oncology space in 2024 brought hope to both industry and patients.\\nR&D\\n\\nPartner Content\\nReturn to Europe for the 2nd IMPACCT Real World Evidence Sum...\\nThe IMPACCT Real World Evidence Summit is back, offering the opportunity to bring together 50+ pharma RWE decision makers to discuss integrated evidence plans, data sharing optimization, infrastruc\\nR&D\\n\\nPartner Content\\n4th Circular & Self-Amplifying RNA Therapeutics Summit\\nWith CSL Seqirus and Arcturus Therapeutics successfully developing the first approved self-amplifying RNA vaccine, the field of next generation RNAs celebrates the potential of circular and self-am\\nGet in-depth news, opinions and features on pharma and healthcare sent straight to your inbox\\nlongevity\\nageing\\nanti-ageing drugs\\nage-related diseases\\ncell senescence\\nCategory : R&D / Views & Analysis\\n\\nEditor's Picks\\n\\n\\nSynchron, Nvidia showcase AI for brain-computer interfaces\\n\\n\\nSanofi signs $1.9bn deal to buy Dren Bio autoimmune drug\\n\\n\\nUK is becoming an 'outlier' for pharma, hitting investment\\n\\n\\nSofinnova closes new fund and backs a trio of new biotechs\\n\\n\\nAZ builds in China, as J&J ramps up its US investments\\n\\n\\nOncology\\n\\nQuantro Therapeutics and the future of drug discovery: Insig...\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nSponsored\\nHealth Trends 2025: Reimagining What's Possible\\nJoin the conversation, on Tuesday 28th January @ 10 am ET - 3 pm GMT - 4 pm CET, in our webinar sponsored by Syneos Health, entitled ‘Health Trends 2025: Reimagining What's Possibl\\nPharmaphorum Menu\\n\\nDigital\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nMarket Access\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nOncology\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nPatients\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nR&D\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\nNews\\nViews & Analysis\\nDeep Dive\\nWebinars\\nPodcasts\\nVideo\\nWhite Papers\\nEvent\\n\\n\\nSpotlight on\\nThe Future of Generics\\nFrontiers Health 2023\\nFrontiers Health 2024\\nLife Science Industry Report\\nWorld Without Disease Summit\\n\\n\\n\\nSign up for email newsletters and Deep Dive\\nSubscribe\\nrss facebook linkedin twitter\\nPharmaphorum\\nAbout us Advertising Contact us\\nContribute Cookie Policy Privacy Policy\\nTerms & Conditions Work for us\\nThe rights of trademark owners are acknowledged.
