The United States has historically relied on some imports of steel and aluminum to keep pace with demand. In 2024, 47% of U.S. aluminum consumption was from imports, and 13% of steel use was from imported steel.\\nHowever, on March 12, a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and derivative products is expected to be implemented.\\nThe Motley Fool has compiled data on steel and aluminum imports to help investors understand exposure, risks, and potential opportunities that come with the tariffs.\\nWhere does the U.S. import steel from?\\nCanada is the top source of U.S. steel imports, followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam.\\nThe United States imported nearly 6 million metric tons of steel from Canada in 2024, roughly 23% of its total steel imports that year. Brazil accounted for 4 million metric tons, or about 16% of all imports. Mexico exported just over 3 million metric tons of steel to the U.S., about 12% of U.S. steel imports.\\nSteel imports from Canada have hovered between 5 million and 6 million metric tons for over a decade, while imports from Mexico have stayed between around 2.5 million and 4.5 million metric tons.\\nSteel imports from China peaked in 2014 at 2.9 million metric tons and have rapidly declined since then due to U.S. tariffs and trade remedies targeting Chinese dumping and subsidies. Steel from China accounted for 1.8% of all U.S. steel imports in 2024, down from 8% in 2014.\\nWhere does the U.S. import aluminum from?\\nCanada is the top source of U.S. aluminum imports, followed by the UAE, China, Russia, and Bahrain.\\nThe U.S. imported just over 3 million metric tons of aluminum from Canada in 2024, roughly 58% of total U.S. aluminum imports that year. Since 2010, Canadian aluminum has accounted for between 40% and 60%, roughly, of U.S. aluminum imports.\\nThe UAE is a distant second, supplying 350,000 metric tons of aluminum to the United States, around 9% of U.S. imports.\\nChinese aluminum imports have fallen by two-thirds since they peaked at 643,000 metric tons in 2017. The U.S. imported 222,000 metric tons of aluminum from China in 2024, about 2% of its total aluminum imports.\\nHow much steel does the U.S. produce?\\nThe United States produced 81 million metric tons of raw steel in 2024, up from 72.7 million metric tons in 2020. The United States is the fourth-largest producer of raw steel in the world, behind China (990 million metric tons), India (150 million metric tons), and Japan (85 million metric tons).\\nHow much aluminum does the U.S. produce?\\nThe United States produced 670,000 metric tons of primary aluminum in 2024, down from 1 million metric tons in 2020 and 1.1 million metric tons in 2019. China is the world’s largest producer of aluminum by far. China pumped out 43 million metric tons of aluminum in 2024. India was a distant second, producing 4.2 million metric tons of aluminum that year.\\nNotably, the United States has the capacity to produce 1.36 million metric tons of aluminum but is using roughly half of it. Just two companies -- Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and Century Aluminum (NASDAQ:CENX) -- are currently producing primary aluminum in the United States across four smelters.\\nWhat investors should know about steel and aluminum tariffs\\nPresident Trump has announced a 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, as well as derivative products, to be imposed on March 12. Unlike the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in 2018, there will be no product exclusions, and the product scope is broader. Prior exemption agreements the United States struck with many major steel- and aluminum-exporting countries will be terminated.\\nSteel and aluminum producers in the United States could stand to benefit from the tariffs -- data shows that U.S. steel and aluminum production increased in 2018 and 2019 when tariffs on those products were in effect. However, there is limited upside given that adding new production capacity to offset higher-priced imports, particularly steel production, would take massive investments and years of infrastructure and talent development.\\nThere is also a risk of foreign retaliatory tariffs, as occurred the last time steel and aluminum tariffs were put in place. That could pose a risk to other sectors of the U.S. economy. Studying which U.S. products major steel and aluminum exporters targeted in response to the previous tariffs would be instructive for investors as the new tariff deadline approaches.\\nSources\\n\\nU.S. International Trade Commission (2025). “Aluminum Import Monitor.”\\nU.S. International Trade Commission (2025). “Steel Import Monitor.”\\nU.S. Geological Survey (2025). “Aluminum Statistics and Information.”\\nU.S. Geological Survey (2025). “Iron and Steel Statistics and Information.”\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n Study: 42% of Parents Aren't Teaching Their Kids to Invest Long-Term Stock Performance in Every Recession Since 1980 The State of LGBTQ Finance: A Survey of 2,000 Americans ESG, SRI, Impact Investing: What Are They, How to Get Started, and How Funds Have Performed State of Streaming 2024: Streaming Services and Consumer Sentiment An Introduction to Digital Real Estate in the Metaverse Average Net Worth by Age, Education, and Race\\nOur Guides\\n Study: 42% of Parents Aren't Teaching Their Kids to Invest Long-Term Stock Performance in Every Recession Since 1980 The State of LGBTQ Finance: A Survey of 2,000 Americans ESG, SRI, Impact Investing: What Are They, How to Get Started, and How Funds Have Performed State of Streaming 2024: Streaming Services and Consumer Sentiment An Introduction to Digital Real Estate in the Metaverse Average Net Worth by Age, Education, and Race Study: Men Are 4x More Likely Than Women to Have Secret Crypto Accounts Study: The Importance of Diverse Investing Role Models Are Alternative Investments the Best Inflation Hedge?

Trump’s tariffs on steel imports, writes Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip K. Bell in today’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — describing how President Trump’s action to close loopholes and exemptions will strengthen the critical industry.\\n“The American steel industry, in other words, is going in reverse, primarily because of increasing imports from exempt countries and product exclusions. With global overcapacity soaring, foreign producers everywhere will take advantage of any gaps in America’s tariffs to find an outlet for their excess steel in the U.S. market.\\nThe harmful impact of a ton of imported steel sold at the domestic industry’s expense does not depend on whether it comes from an ‘ally’ or ‘adversary’ country.\\nA stable supply of domestically produced steel is more important than ever to America’s national, economic and energy security. In the face of the considerable pressure likely to come to exempt certain countries and weaken the tariffs, the president has stayed strong and continued to put America first on steel trade.”\\nRead the full op-ed here.\\n\\nNews\\nAdministration\\nIssues\\nContact\\nVisit\\nGallery\\nEOP\\n\\n\\nThe White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\\nWashington, DC 20500\\n\\nX\\nInstagram\\nFacebook\\n\\nWH.GOV\\n\\nCopyright\\nPrivacy\\nStyle Guide\\n\\nBack to top', 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 2.01}\n"

From the escalating cost of raw materials to shifts in demand and production strategies, businesses are adjusting to the new realities of a tariff-driven market.\\nMarch 13, 2025\\nBy Dan Hilliard\\nAluminium Global Steel United States\\nSteel producers, distributors and end users took a range of views on the second round of Section 232 steel and aluminium tariffs on Wednesday March 12, the first day they formally came into effect. The effective tariff increase to 25% hit all imports of steel and aluminium, as well as derivative products made from the metals; prior exemptions and quotas have expired.\\nWhile the threat of tariff pressure has been\\xa0pushing steel prices up\\xa0— in line with\\xa0industry sentiment\\xa0— the overall effect of the tariffs on the health of the steel supply chain remains an open question.\\nSome downstream producers are opposed to pitting an increase in prices against lackluster consumer demand, while others are encouraged by the new tariffs’ inclusion of derivative products.\\n“Including steel derivatives makes a lot of sense,” said Alliance for American Manufacturing president Scott Paul in a March 12 statement. “This addition will ensure that importers can’t game the system and American companies that make these products have a level playing field.”\\nOne steel distributor and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) manufacturer — as well as a long-time tariff supporter — told Fastmarkets that he is concerned that tariff-driven price increases may not hang around without an uptick in demand.\\n“I think the tariffs will continue to cause consumers to ‘panic’ buy, though I don’t know how much longer that will stick without the demand,” the distributor said.\\n“Even though we are getting a lot of calls, many customers are still getting ‘deals’ from service centers that are not raising prices when they should be. If the tariffs end up coming off or being watered down, I could see the price of steel dropping again, especially since scrap for March isn’t as stellar as experts once thought it would be,” the source added.\\nAt the other end of the market, at least two major steel producer trade groups praised the new round of Section 232 tariffs.\\nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) president and chief executive officer Kevin Dempsey praised the new tariffs’ lack of an exclusion process which foreign producers allegedly “exploited as a loophole.”\\n“AISI applauds the president’s actions to restore the integrity of the tariffs on steel and implement a robust and reinvigorated program to address unfair trade practices,” Dempsey said in a March 12 statement. “America must have a sustainable, commercially viable steel industry to meet its national security needs.”\\nThe sentiment was echoed by Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.\\n“As the revised steel tariff goes into effect [on March 12], President Trump is boldly declaring that America will no longer be a dumping ground for cheap, subsidized foreign steel,” he said. “By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America.”\\nLearn more about our reliable data-driven insights, market-reflective prices, forecasts and analysis.\\nWhat to read next\\n\\nAddition of missing soybean crush margin values\\nAG-SYB-0078\\xa0Crush Margin China Soy (Brazil) March 20, 2024:M1:\\xa0104.25 yuan per tonneM2:\\xa063.25 yuan per tonneM3:\\xa043.25 yuan per tonneM4:\\xa0-44.75 yuan per tonneM5:\\xa0-122.25 yuan per tonneM6:\\xa0-132.75 yuan per tonne August 21, 2024:M1:\\xa0-5 yuan per tonneM2:\\xa0-6.75 yuan per tonneM3:\\xa0-50.25 yuan per tonneM4:\\xa0-100.5 yuan per tonneM5:\\xa023.5 yuan per tonneM6:\\xa034.5 yuan per tonne AG-SYB-0079\\xa0Crush Margin China Soy (US Gulf) March 20, […]\\nMarch 28, 2025\\n·\\xa0\\nBy the Fastmarkets team\\n\\nKey talking points ahead of Fastmarkets’ Bauxite & Alumina Conference in Miami\\nFalling alumina prices, geopolitics and a volatile aluminium market will be the hot topics during the Fastmarkets’ annual Bauxite & Alumina Conference, taking place in Miami, Florida on April 2-4.\\nMarch 28, 2025\\n·\\xa0\\nBy Sayaka Kurata\\n\\nOpen consultation on annual methodology review for US pig iron import assessment\\nThis consultation, which is open until April 28, 2025, seeks to ensure that our methodologies continue to reflect the physical market, in compliance with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) principles for Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs).

Manage Subscriptions\\nSubscribe  \\nRight now, the US is preparing to expand a 25% tariff to a wider range of imported steel and aluminum products while also eliminating exemptions for all countries and importers, without exception.\\nThe Trump administration announced the impending tariffs on February 10 on the grounds of national security. They would newly apply to key trading partners, such as the EU and Canada, that so far have been excluded from duties or subject to quotas since the tariffs were first imposed in 2018. US manufacturers and other importers will no longer have recourse to individual exclusions.\\nThe new tariffs go into effect on March 12. They will apply to a range of products, including steel, aluminum, and certain “derivatives” containing the metals that will be taxed based on their steel and aluminum content.\\nThe So What\\nThe new tariffs would have a far-reaching impact on manufacturing costs and supply chains across a range of industries in the US and exporting nations. Current US tariffs will extend to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, which together account for around three-quarters of US steel imports by volume.\\n“Steel and aluminum producers and customers must move swiftly to understand what these tariffs will mean to them and how they can mitigate any negative impact,” says Nicole Voigt, a BCG managing director and partner who co-leads the firm’s work in metals.\\nIf implemented as announced, BCG projects that, once everything is priced in, the new steel and aluminum tariffs would:\\n\\nAdd $22.4 billion to the cost of steel and aluminum products the US imports and up to an additional $29 billion for derivative products.\\nIncrease the affected amount of imported steel from 7 million metric tons to 26 million. With the expansion to “derivative” products, such as elevator parts, bulldozer blades, lamps, and structural steel, the value of goods being tariffed could more than double to $72 billion.\\nIncrease the affected amount of imported aluminum from 2.3 million metric tons to 3.5 million. When derivative products like baseball bats and some aircraft and kitchen appliance parts are included, the value of goods being tariffed would reach $132 billion.\\nMost heavily affect the US metals manufacturing industry, the biggest user of imported steel and aluminum (24% and 35% import dependence respectively). The automotive, mechanical machinery, construction industries, and various consumer sectors will also be significantly impacted.\\nBoost prices and profit margins for US steel and aluminum manufacturers.\\n\\n“Many companies are already starting to update their pricing and optimize their inventory and supply chains, ” says Janice Lee, who co-leads BCG’s global work in metals. “Others are discussing potential capacity expansion.”\\nThese estimates don’t account for retaliatory actions taken by US trading partners and counter measures the US may take in response. The EU and Canada have indicated they will retaliate against US exports but have not yet released details.\\nFurther trade actions may come. For instance, the February 10 executive order provides a mechanism for US steel and aluminum producers and industry associations to seek extending the tariffs to even more derivative goods containing steel or aluminum.\\nUnlike the tariffs imposed in President Trump’s first term, moreover, US steel and aluminum customers will have limited ways to avoid paying the duties. The US has granted more than 100,000 individual exclusions since 2018 to importers that demonstrate limited domestic availability of specific steel and aluminum products. That system for granting or renewing exclusions is now shut.\\nThe Trump administration is taking a different approach to steel and aluminum tariffs than it did in 2018.\\n“This time, there is less dealmaking with countries and no room for companies to get exceptions,” says Iacob Koch-Weser, a BCG associate director who specializes in trade and investment.\\n“The main options are to source domestically or pay more for imported materials. Shifting sourcing locations is less useful if everyone faces the same tariffs.”\\nSubscribe to receive BCG insights on the most pressing issues facing international business.\\nSubscribe\\nManage Subscriptions \\nNow What\\nThe key issues and options facing business leaders largely depend on their place in the value chain.\\nUS steel and aluminum companies in the short term will need to manage change in demand through pricing and adjusting production and inventory. Over the longer term, they should determine whether to invest in more capacity, explore making higher value-added products that have primarily been imported thus far, and improve operational efficiency to remain competitive.\\nUS steel and aluminum customers must immediately calculate the tariffs’ impact on their material costs and their prices. They should identify ways to mitigate impact, such as by documenting their products’ metals content to qualify for lower tariffs, renegotiating with current metals suppliers, shifting to other suppliers, or using alternative materials.\\nExporters of steel and aluminum products to the US should determine whether they can remain cost-competitive in this market, and in which segments. Without the exemptions that existed previously, exporters will need to reassess the competitive landscape. They can also consider diversifying exports to other regions to offset revenue lost in the US.\\nRelated Content\\n\\nInternational Trade\\nArticle\\nJanuary 13, 2025\\nGreat Powers, Geopolitics, and the Future of Trade\\nNew BCG research forecasts dramatic changes in world trade flows in the coming decade as national alliances, rivalries, and aspirations rewire the global economy.\\nLearn More\\n\\nInternational Trade\\nArticle\\nFebruary 13, 2025\\nHow to Prepare for Tariffs and the New Reality of Global Trade\\nIf implemented, new tariffs would affect 44% of all US imports.

While tariffs typically increase costs for businesses reliant on imports, they can also create opportunities for domestic companies that benefit from reduced foreign competition or government incentives.\\nFor financial advisors and asset managers, understanding which sectors stand to gain from these policy changes is crucial for identifying investment opportunities and mitigating portfolio risks.\\nThis analysis will highlight:\\n\\nThe industries and companies that could benefit from tariff-related protectionism\\nKey ETFs and funds with exposure to these outperforming sectors\\nHow financial professionals can navigate investment strategies in response to changing trade dynamics\\n\\n\\nIndustries & Companies Positioned to Benefit from Tariffs\\n1. Domestic Manufacturing & Industrials\\nCompanies with strong U.S.-based production facilities will likely see a competitive advantage as higher import costs make American-made goods more attractive.\\nPotential Beneficiaries:\\n\\nCaterpillar Inc.

These taxes on imported goods occupy a unique position between foreign and domestic policy. Though often misunderstood, tariffs hold popular appeal as a tool of economic and foreign policy. But for agribusinesses, tariffs are a serious business concern. Understanding tariff policies—and how they affect US producers—is a core element in agribusiness success.\\nTariff positioning versus its practical effects\\nLately, policymakers, in the interest of national security, have favored some degree of protectionism to shield US companies from unfair trade practices. Tariffs designed to protect domestic steel production are among the most well-known of these initiatives.\\nRarely do those favoring protectionism recognize that countries targeted with tariffs invariably respond with retaliatory duties and tariffs of their own. Agribusinesses understand this truth all too well. They withstand the worst of retaliatory tariffs, due to the large share of US export volume that agricultural products represent. It’s estimated that the 2018 US tariff on steel and aluminum imports resulted in retaliatory tariffs that cost US agricultural producers $27 billion from 2018 to 2019. footnoteDisclosure 1\\nThe tariff “bark” may be worse than the bite.\\nPoliticians like to talk of tariffs in terms of protecting American jobs. But unlike voters, elected leaders know better than to expect much of this tough talk to reach fruition.\\nCountries that are subject to tariffs routinely bring disputes to the World Trade Organization (WTO) where they’re often deemed to violate international trade rules. In 2018, when the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from several countries, the exporting countries initiated a dispute. Unsurprisingly, WTO arbiters ruled that the US tariffs were inconsistent with global trade agreements.\\nEven when importing countries do manage to implement tariffs, and global trade policy becomes combative, the effects can be transient. While China’s retaliation to 2018 US tariffs led to a large drop in US agricultural exports to China, the volume has rebounded to a large degree.\\nIn addition, the US government often provides financial aid to food producers to help them weather any trade retaliation. US farmers received $23 billion through the USDA’s Market Facilitation Program in 2018 and 2019 to offset export losses resulting from retaliatory tariffs.footnoteDisclosure 2\\nTariffs are one of many global demand controls.\\nEven with WTO disputes, government subsidies, and the softening effects of time, tariffs do have an impact on US agriculture—and producers should expect to continue feeling their effects. That said, other dynamics could be more influential in shaping demand.\\nThough the US and China may opt to escalate their tariff tit-for-tat game, it plays a relatively minor role in the bigger agricultural trade picture. China’s slowing economy and aging population are already reducing US exports of soybeans and corn. An oversupply of grain in China has driven the country’s orders for US soy down dramatically. As of mid-September, orders for the 2024-2025 season were at one of their lowest points in 16 years.footnoteDisclosure 3\\nTense relations between the two countries are also spurring strategic moves—actions with long-term impacts that are likely to lower trade volumes and minimize mutual dependency. China is intent on ramping up efficiency in domestic agricultural production and investing in the development of Brazilian farmland for corn, soy, and wheat production.\\nProducers have more to watch than tariffs.\\nTariff considerations aside, farmers have plenty of other concerns to keep an eye on this fall. Policy differences around fossil fuels and climate change could meaningfully affect the price of key inputs like fuel and fertilizer. The same issues could impact biofuels, and alternative fuels that are based in agriculture, leaving farmers who produce the inputs to these fuels to sort through ramifications of the latest energy policies. Either way, don’t expect the costs of fuel or fertilizer, or the proceeds from selling biofuel feedstock, to provide\\xa0immediate relief.\\nTo create lasting cost reductions, increase your commitment to new technologies and adopt more efficient farming practices.\\nAnd then there’s the congressional quagmire to consider. The 2018 Farm Bill expired September 30, 2024. Government support is crucial for the many farmers that are under tremendous financial strain. But with the parties divided on policies, programs, and the appropriate focus of funding, it likely won’t be until sometime in\\xa02025 that a new bill is passed.\\nAgribusiness can mitigate the impact of continued tariffs.\\nHow should agribusinesses respond to this uncertainty? Short of strategic shifts into product lines—with less exposure to potential tariff action—there’s not much that will directly reduce the impact of tariffs and other external forces. And for many companies, making those changes, if they’re possible, would take quite a bit of time.\\nEnhance your competitive edge by focusing on what you can control.\\n\\nInvest in AI and machine learning. Advanced digital technologies can enhance supply chain efficiency and lower costs through precise application of chemicals.\\xa0\\nIncrease automation. Automated equipment can reduce labor costs, increase product quality, and improve productivity.\\xa0\\n\\nTo create lasting cost reductions, increase your commitment to new technologies and adopt more efficient farming practices which benefit your agribusiness independent of tariff structures, trade policies, and fluctuating global demand scenarios.\\nGrow your agribusiness despite tariff uncertainty.\\nOur food industry specialists can offer you insights, ideas, and solutions to help you navigate tariffs and other business developments.

The last of these quarterly\\xa0reports for 2024 was released shortly after this year’s election results. With a trade deficit widening and proposed tariffs on the horizon, farmers and ranchers are left grappling with how these shifts might affect their operations and market access.\\nIn this article, we cover key insights from this report and provide commentary on how the incoming administration’s expected policy shifts could influence the U.S. agricultural trade outlook moving forward.\\nKey Highlights from USDA’s Agricultural Trade Outlook for 2025\\nU.S. Agricultural Trade Exports\\nU.S. agricultural exports are projected to reach $170 billion in FY 2025, a $500 million increase from August’s forecast. Gains in livestock and dairy exports ($39.3 billion) are leading this growth, with beef and dairy products performing especially well. Horticultural exports are also on the rise, forecasted at $41.7 billion.\\nHowever, some sectors face challenges. Oilseed exports are expected to decline to $33.5 billion due to reduced demand and competition, while cotton exports are forecasted at $4.3 billion, reflecting a similar downward trend.\\nU.S. Agricultural Trade Imports\\nOn the import side, the USDA projects a rise to $215.5 billion, driven by increased demand for horticultural and tropical products such as fruits, nuts, and sugar. Since 2020, agricultural trade imports have increased as much as 50 percent, while U.S. agricultural exports have increased 22 percent. This widening trade gap can be attributed to a mixture of factors, including but not limited to:\\n\\nA decline in U.S. agricultural exports to China, a top agricultural export market. \\xa0\\nIncrease in U.S. consumer demand for imported agricultural products.\\xa0\\nDrought and severe weather conditions in the U.S. lowering yields and increasing import demand.\\xa0\\n\\nThis growing agricultural trade deficit also underscores the importance of maintaining diversified markets and minimizing trade barriers to sustain export momentum.\\nU.S. Agricultural Trading Partners\\nExports to Mexico are forecast to grow to $29.9 billion, a $700 million increase. Exports to Canada are expected to hit a record high of $29.2 billion due to stronger-than-expected demand for beef, fruits, and vegetables.\\nBy contrast, exports to China are projected to decline by $700 million, settling at $23.3 billion, due to low soybean exports and lagging cotton sales. However, this outlook could be disrupted by new trade policies.\\nAgricultural Trade and Tariff Policy in 2025\\nThe incoming administration’s selection of Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary signals a return to aggressive tariff strategies. Lutnick, a staunch advocate of using tariffs as leverage, aligns with the president-elect’s protectionist vision. Other key appointments, including Jamieson Greer as U.S. Trade Representative and Kevin Hassett as the head of the National Economic Council, further cement this approach.\\nSo far, the administration has announced plans for:\\n\\nA 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico.\\xa0\\nA 10 percent additional tariff on Chinese goods, with potential for higher rates.\\xa0\\nA possible across-the-board 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports.\\xa0\\n\\nMany in the U.S. ag sector are discussing the impacts these proposals could have on the farm community—for better or worse.\\nPotential Impacts of Proposed Tariffs on U.S. Agricultural Trade\\nThere are several ways these proposed tariff policies could influence the future of U.S. agricultural trade. Some say they would widen the trade deficit and increase costs. Others argue they could be a leveraging tool to improve future trade deals and encourage domestic production.\\nMarket Disruptions\\nThe proposed tariffs risk destabilizing trade deals like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and jeopardizing tariff-free trade with two of the nation’s top agricultural export markets. Retaliatory measures from Mexico and Canada could further strain relationships and reduce competitiveness. Additionally, escalating tariffs on Chinese goods risk undermining already declining exports to the U.S.’s third-largest agricultural trade markets.\\nEconomic Implications\\nFarmers reliant on imported machinery, fertilizers, and other inputs may face higher costs, cutting into already tight margins. Consumers and farmers alike could experience inflationary pressures, particularly as retailers like Walmart and Lowe’s warn of price increases tied to rising import costs.\\nFederal Government Support\\nIf tariffs begin to significantly impact farm revenues, the government may renew support programs such as the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) or other subsidies. These programs have historically provided billions of dollars to farmers as compensation for lost trade opportunities.\\nDomestic Production\\nBy making imported goods more expensive, the tariffs could encourage greater investment in domestic manufacturing and agriculture, potentially creating new opportunities for U.S. farmers and ranchers.\\nRenewed Trade Deals\\nIf successful, these policies could reduce foreign tariffs and non-tariff barriers,\\xa0improve terms in renegotiated agreements, or address unfair trade practices or subsidies used by competing nations.\\nManaging Risk Through Agricultural Trade Turbulence\\nOpinions differ on whether trade tariffs will ultimately help or harm agricultural trade in the long run, but experts overwhelmingly agree on one thing—disruption will occur if implemented.\\nHere are several ways you can proactively manage the risk of trade turbulence in 2025.\\n\\nDiversify markets. If you rely heavily on export trade, now is the time to explore emerging markets and reduce your dependence on vulnerable trade channels.\\xa0\\nEngage in policy discussions. Farmer advocacy will continue to play a vital role in shaping trade policy. Reach out to your local representatives and industry groups to ensure your voice is heard.\\xa0\\nStay informed. Monitor developments in U.S. relations with top agricultural trade partners like Mexico, Canada, and China to align your business strategies with evolving realities and adapt as needed. \\xa0\\nPlan ahead. Producers should prepare for potential cost increases and revenue fluctuations by leveraging federal support programs and flexible financing options. Be proactive in discussing ways to better secure your financial stability with your lender if you believe these trade policies could directly impact your operation. \\xa0\\n\\nTrade-Proofing Your Farm Finances\\nThe latest agricultural trade outlook offers both promise and caution. While export growth in key sectors is encouraging, the looming uncertainty of new tariffs could disrupt established markets and strain farm finances.\\nThrough it all, AgAmerica is here to help.

How will tariffs impact this?\\nThe U.S. agricultural trade landscape is facing a year of heightened volatility in 2025. The USDA’s first agricultural trade outlook\\xa0this year predicts a record trade deficit, with agricultural exports expected to reach $170.5 billion as imports climb to $219.5 billion. Shifting global demand, lower export values for key commodities, and new tariffs under the Trump administration are all contributing factors.\\n\\nThe combination of rising imports and stagnant exports signals an uphill battle ahead for newly confirmed U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer. For farmers and agribusiness owners, here is a brief overview of the agricultural trade outlook and dynamics in 2025 that could impact your operation.\\nFirst Quarter Agricultural Trade Outlook in 2025: Key Highlights\\nThe USDA’s latest trade outlook underscores several key shifts ahead in agricultural trade.\\nExports\\nLivestock, poultry, and dairy exports are forecast to rise to $39.7 billion, supported by increasing in U.S. beef and dairy products. Grain and feed exports are expected to reach $37.7 billion, driven by higher corn exports. However, oilseed exports, particularly soybeans, are projected to decline to $32.4 billion due to reduced demand from China and strong competition from Brazil and Argentina.\\xa0U.S. cotton exports are also down to $4.1 billion due to lower volumes.\\nImports\\nAgricultural imports are set to increase to $219.5 billion, $13 billion higher than last year’s record and $4 billion higher than November’s 2025 agricultural trade outlook. This increase is reflected mostly in higher demand for horticultural products, coffee, and processed foods. Rising consumer preference for fresh produce, nuts, and specialty food products continues to drive import growth, particularly from Latin America and Europe.\\nTrading Partners\\nWhile exports to Mexico are on the rise, shipments to China and Canada—the other two leading agricultural export markets—are in decline. Lower-than-expected sales of baked and prepared goods, corn, feed, and distiller grains are to blame for the decline in exports to Canada,\\xa0while competition from South American grain along with increased self-sufficiency efforts are contributing to the decline of U.S. imports to China. Meanwhile, opportunities for expanded exports to Southeast Asia and the Middle East may provide new avenues for U.S. farmers. Countries like Indonesia and Vietnam are showing increased demand for U.S. wheat and dairy products, while Middle Eastern markets are importing more beef and poultry. The European Union export forecast is also up slightly due to strong sales of distilled spirits and tree nuts.\\nThe Tariff Effect on Agricultural Trade\\nWe would be remiss not to address one looming factor that has already begun to impact the U.S. agricultural trade outlook—tariffs. Events are unfolding quickly, but at the time of this writing, here’s a short timeline of what’s officially happened so far:\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2025: An executive order is released that announces a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China. \\xa0\\nFebruary 3, 2025: One day before going into effect, President Trump agrees to delay the 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada tariffs for 30 days, following discussions on border security and drug trafficking enforcement. \\xa0\\nFebruary 10, 2025: President Trump announces 25 percent tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports, effective March 12, 2025, removing previous exemptions. \\xa0\\nFebruary 13, 2025: The administration orders a review of reciprocal tariffs, examining trade balances and foreign tariffs, with a report due in 180 days.\\xa0\\nMarch 3, 2025: Trump confirms that 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports will take effect on March 4, citing border security and trade imbalances. The 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports is raised to 20 percent. \\xa0\\nMarch 4, 2025: In response to the new U.S. tariffs, China announces that it will impose additional tariffs on key U.S. agricultural products. Starting March 10, an additional 15 percent tariff will be imposed on imported chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton. Sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products will be subject to an additional 10 percent tariff. President Trump also announces the U.S. will impose reciprocal tariffs starting on April 2, 2025.\\xa0\\nMarch 6, 2025: President Trump announces that any product covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement coming from Mexico will receive a one-month exemption from new 25 percent duties.\\n\\nThese policies have sparked concerns over retaliatory measures. Canada, Mexico, and China are all critical markets for U.S. agriculture, accounting for nearly 37 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. Higher tariffs could lead to decreased demand and loss of global market share\\xa0for American farm products.\\nIt could also increase input costs for farmers relying on imported goods, such as fertilizers, machinery, and chemicals. Tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico may increase prices on critical farm supplies such as potash-based fertilizers, while higher levies on Chinese goods could drive up the cost of agricultural equipment, pesticides, and animal feed ingredients.\\nIn addition, as both consumers and producers, farmers may feel the impacts of higher grocery store costs if these prices are passed to the consumer as most Americans expect.\\n\\nThis combination will likely put pressure on farm margins this year, making cost management an essential strategy for producers in 2025.\\nMinimizing the Impact of Agricultural Trade Risk\\nWith trade dynamics shifting, there are several strategies farmers and agribusiness owners can implement now to mitigate agricultural trade risk.\\nMarket Diversification\\nExpand exports to alternative markets beyond China, Canada, and Mexico, such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, where demand for U.S. agricultural products is growing. Shifting focus to domestic markets could also benefit U.S. operators who were previously priced out by lower import costs.\\nCost Management\\nStress test increases in input costs due to tariffs and adjust your financial strategy accordingly. Explore bulk purchasing, strategic supplier partnerships, and cost-cutting measures to help ease financial strain.\\nSupply Chain Resilience\\nStrengthen relationships with domestic suppliers and explore alternative sourcing options to reduce dependency on imported goods. Invest in localized supply chains to insulate your operation from trade-related disruptions.\\nAdvocacy and Engagement\\nStay updated on trade policy changes and new federal support programs as they emerge. While temporary relief through the Commodity Credit Corporation is under consideration for farmers affected by tariffs, no official announcement has been made yet. Stay engaged with industry organizations and make your voice heard to ensure the agricultural sector’s concerns are included in policy discussions.\\nSupporting American Agriculture Through Thick and Thin\\nThe 2025 agricultural trade outlook presents both challenges and opportunities. While operations that rely more heavily on export trade will be more directly impacted, secondary impacts of higher input costs could trickle down to other producers as well. The silver lining involves the opportunity within the domestic market, as tariffs could level the playing field and increase the competitive advantage of domestic producers. Either way, farmers who proactively manage costs and explore new markets will be better positioned for success.\\nAt AgAmerica, we remain committed to providing financial solutions and resources that empower farmers to withstand market fluctuations.

Defined as taxes or duties imposed on imported or exported goods, tariffs serve various purposes, from protecting domestic industries to generating government revenue. However, the effects of tariffs are complex and far-reaching, influencing prices, trade balances, and competitive dynamics across industries.\\nFor example, in 2018, the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect local producers. While this boosted demand for US-made steel, it also raised costs for industries relying on steel, like automotive and construction, and led to retaliatory tariffs from trade partners, affecting US exports and global competitive dynamics.\\nIn recent years, tariffs have become a particularly hot topic due to escalating trade tensions and significant policy shifts, especially between the US and its key trade partners. Recent developments, such as the US-China trade war and broader global economic shifts, have prompted renewed debate about the effectiveness of tariffs and their \\xa0impacts.\\nThe current environment of globalization and economic interdependence means that tariffs, even when intended to help domestic industries, often have mixed and sometimes unintended or unanticipated consequences. By understanding how sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, technology and retail can adapt, we can gain insight into the broader economic implications of tariffs and how businesses navigate these challenges.\\nUnderstanding tariffs\\nTariffs are essentially taxes imposed on goods as they cross international borders. They play a crucial role in trade policy, serving to either protect domestic industries from foreign competition or to raise government revenue. By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs can encourage consumers to buy domestically produced alternatives. However, they also have the potential to raise consumer prices and disrupt supply chains.\\nThere are several types of tariffs:\\n\\nThe US has a long history of using tariffs. In the late 19th century, for example, tariffs were a primary source of government revenue. Over the years, however, US tariff policy has evolved, particularly in response to globalization and shifts in political power. Notable recent developments include the Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese imports, which led to retaliatory tariffs from China, sparking a trade war that has had lingering effects on multiple US industries.\\nIndustries most affected by US tariffs\\nManufacturing: Heavy machinery, automobiles, and consumer electronics\\nManufacturing is one of the\\xa0industries most heavily impacted by tariffs, particularly those relying on imported components. Industries such as automotive, heavy machinery, and consumer electronics are deeply integrated into global supply chains, making them vulnerable to tariff increases on imported goods. For example, tariffs on Chinese imports have led to increased costs for companies reliant on electronic components, steel and aluminum.\\nAs a result, many manufacturers have passed these increased costs onto consumers through price hikes. Companies like Ford and General Motors have had to reevaluate their production strategies, with some shifting production to countries unaffected by the tariffs or\\xa0using local suppliers to mitigate the impact.\\nKey success factors for manufacturing professionals:\\n\\nDiversify your supplier base to minimize exposure to tariffs from specific regions and reduce supply chain risks.\\nEnhance inventory management practices to better handle cost fluctuations caused by tariffs and maintain product availability.\\nInvest in automation and technology to lower reliance on imported materials and improve operational efficiency.\\n\\nAgriculture: Farmers and exported goods\\nThe agricultural sector has been hit particularly hard by tariffs, especially those imposed on US exports like soybeans, dairy, and pork. China, one of the largest markets for US agricultural products, retaliated against US tariffs by imposing its own duties on these goods, significantly reducing demand. Farmers have found themselves caught in the middle of these trade disputes, experiencing reduced revenue and uncertainty in global markets.\\nUS soybean farmers, who rely heavily on exports to China, saw a drastic reduction in sales due to the retaliatory tariffs. In response, farmers have sought new markets, while others have had to cut production or shift to alternative crops. The ripple effect of tariffs on agriculture extends beyond farmers, affecting global supply chains and consumer prices.\\n\\nSteel and aluminum: The impact of protective tariffs\\nThe steel and aluminum industries have been at the center of US protective tariff policies, especially during the Trump administration. The intent was to boost domestic production by imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports. While US steel producers benefited from these policies, downstream industries, such as\\xa0construction, automotive, and manufacturing, faced increased costs for raw materials.\\nFor example, while domestic steel manufacturers saw an uptick in demand, companies in industries that rely on steel faced higher input costs. Construction companies, in particular, have to deal with rising material costs, which has led to higher prices for consumers and reduced profit.\\nKey success factors for mining professionals:\\n\\nSecuring long-term contracts with domestic buyers can stabilize demand and provide predictable revenue amidst tariff fluctuations.\\nExpanding value-added services like ore processing enables mining companies to offer comprehensive solutions and strengthen supply chain ties.\\nEnhancing ESG compliance makes mining firms more attractive to sustainability-focused partners, potentially improving investment appeal.\\n\\nIndustries less affected by US tariffs\\nTechnology and software: Focus on digital products\\nThe technology and software industry, which relies heavily on digital products and services, has been relatively insulated from the direct impact of tariffs. Software, cloud services, and digital platforms, for instance, are not typically subject to traditional tariff regulations. However, segments of the tech industry that depend on physical components—such as hardware manufacturers, semiconductor producers, and electronics makers—are more vulnerable to tariffs on imported goods. For example, manufacturers of smartphones, laptops, and networking equipment often source parts from multiple countries, making them more exposed to tariffs on imports like chips and screens.\\nIn contrast, companies focused purely on software and cloud infrastructure, like Google and Microsoft, are less affected by tariffs on physical goods but may still feel the impact of trade restrictions if data localization laws or digital service taxes arise. As global supply chains shift, the physical side of tech often faces added costs, while digital-focused areas remain comparatively shielded, enabling a more flexible adaptation to trade barriers.\\nThe global nature of the technology industry also allows companies to adapt more flexibly to trade barriers by moving production or services across borders. For example, companies like Google and Microsoft can provide digital products that are less susceptible to tariffs than physical goods. Still, global shifts in production often cause domestic job losses as companies move operations abroad to mitigate costs, impacting local economies and labor markets.\\nHealthcare and pharmaceuticals: Shielded by domestic production\\nThe healthcare and pharmaceutical industries are also less affected by tariffs, as many of their supplies and products are domestically produced or exempt from tariffs due to their critical nature. For example, many medical devices and pharmaceuticals are manufactured in the US or within trade agreements that protect them from heavy tariffs.\\nWhile some supplies may be imported, the essential nature of healthcare products has led governments to ensure these goods remain exempt from tariffs to avoid disrupting the healthcare system. As a result, this industry has been largely shielded from the negative impacts of trade tensions.\\nKey success factors for healthcare and pharmaceutical professionals:\\n\\nDiversify sourcing strategies across trade-friendly regions to secure alternative sources for essential products.\\nOptimize inventory for critical items to buffer against supply disruptions and sudden policy changes.\\nBuild strong relationships with reliable suppliers to ensure access to essential goods with tariff exemptions.\\n\\n\\nRetail and e-commerce: Mixed impacts\\nThe retail and e-commerce sectors have experienced mixed impacts from tariffs, largely depending on their reliance on imported goods. Retailers that depend on foreign-manufactured products, such as clothing, electronics, and consumer goods, have faced increased costs due to tariffs. However, the ongoing popularity of e-commerce and digital shopping platforms have enabled many companies to adapt by sourcing products globally or shifting production to countries outside the scope of US tariffs.\\nFor example, retailers like Walmart and Amazon, which operate massive supply chains, have been able to mitigate tariff impacts by diversifying their sourcing and negotiating favorable terms with suppliers. E-commerce has also allowed companies to explore new markets and regions that are unaffected by tariffs.\\nThe economic implications of tariffs\\nTariffs have broad economic implications that extend beyond the industries directly affected. One of the most immediate impacts is the potential for higher consumer prices. As companies pass on the increased cost of imported goods to consumers, this can lead to inflationary pressures, which in turn affect purchasing power and consumer confidence.\\nTariffs can have a ripple effect on global supply chains, disrupting the flow of goods and services which can lead to \\xa0inefficiencies. Industries that rely on complex, multinational supply chains may face delays, increased costs, and uncertainty. In the long term, these disruptions can affect the competitiveness of US industries on a global scale, hindering innovation and economic growth.\\nAdditionally, tariffs can strain international relations and lead to retaliatory measures, further complicating global trade dynamics. As countries impose their own tariffs in response to US policies, industries that rely on exports may find themselves facing reduced access to key markets.\\n\\nFinal Word\\nTariffs remain a powerful tool in shaping global trade policy, with far-reaching effects on various industries. Recent tariff policies have heavily impacted sectors like manufacturing and agriculture, while other industries such as technology and healthcare, have remained relatively insulated. The broader economic implications of tariffs, including higher consumer prices, supply chain disruptions and reduced competitiveness, highlight the need for businesses to adopt adaptive strategies.\\nLooking ahead, the future of US tariff policies remains uncertain, as global trade tensions continue to evolve. However, industries that proactively manage these challenges will be better positioned to navigate the complexities of a tariff-laden global economy.\\nRecommended for you\\n\\nTariffs and Tensions: Analyzing Trump’s Trade Strategy\\nPresident-Elect Trump is poised to take office, bringing along a wide range of sweeping tariffs with the potential to repave geopolitics and the international trade landscape.\\nEvan Jozkowski\\n8 min read\\nUnited States Analyst Insights Data Analysis Tariffs\\n\\nThe Impact of the New UK Global Tariff Regime\\nWhen the UK's transition period with the European Union ends on 31 December 2020, the EU’s Common Tariff Regime is set to be replaced by a new system.\\nChristian Shiba\\n5 min read\\nUnited Kingdom Analyst Insights Strategy Brexit\\n\\nBetter Together: Integrating IBISWorld & RelPro to Support Business Development Initiatives in Banking\\nPairing IBISWorld with RelPro provides a comprehensive prospecting solution for banking institutions.

This response underscores the rising tensions in global trade relations, potentially destabilizing decades of cooperation.\\n\\nEconomic analysts are warning that the tariffs could fuel inflation, driving up the costs of essential goods such as groceries, gasoline, housing, and automobiles, apparel and footwear—issues central to Trump’s campaign promises of reducing living expenses for Americans. There are growing concerns that these policies, while aimed at securing the US economy and borders, could disrupt global supply chains.\\n\\nWith retaliatory actions expected from key trading partners, this escalation poses a critical challenge to US diplomatic relations and could reshape international trade dynamics. This moment marks a defining test of the administration’s ability to balance economic nationalism with the realities of a globalised economy, potentially reshaping both domestic and global trade strategies.\\n\\nImpact of the 25 per cent Tariff on Mexican Textile and Apparel Exports\\n\\nA quick analysis of the export data highlights Mexico’s strong dependence on the US market for its textile, apparel, and footwear industries. The newly imposed 25 per cent import tariff on all Mexican products is expected to significantly impact these key export categories, which collectively account for approximately 85 per cent of Mexico’s total textile-related exports to the United States.\\n\\nThus, the 25 per cent tariff imposition on Mexican goods poses a serious threat to the country's dominant textile and apparel exports, particularly as they constitute a significant share of trade with the US. While businesses may explore alternative markets or cost-cutting measures, the immediate effect could be reduced export volumes, disrupted supply chains, and increased production costs, with broader implications for trade relations between the two nations\\n\\nImpact of the 25 per cent Tariff on Canadian Textile and Apparel Exports\\n\\nAs a USMCA member, Canada has a strong trade relationship with the US in textiles and apparel. Clothing dominates exports, with HS Code 62 (non-knitted apparel) at $617.45 million and HS Code 61 (knitted apparel) at $403.79 million, contributing 24.90 per cent of total exports. Technical textiles (HS Code 59) hold an 18.06 per cent share, reflecting growing US demand for advanced materials in healthcare, automotive, and industrial sectors. Other key categories include:\\n\\nTraditional textiles like wool, cotton, and silk play a minor role, highlighting a shift towards value-added and sustainable products.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, the 25 per cent tariff may reshape North American textile trade, prompting US buyers to seek new suppliers and Canadian firms to explore alternative markets. Adaptation through innovation and cost efficiency will be crucial for maintaining competitiveness.\\n\\nPotential Beneficiaries of US Tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese Imports\\n\\nWith 25 per cent tariffs imposed on Canadian and Mexican textile and apparel exports, US buyers will likely diversify sourcing to lower-cost, tariff-free alternatives.

Moreover, exports of miscellaneous textile products, home furnishings, and apparel returned to 2019 pre-pandemic exports levels.[5] Further, exports to the United States’ largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, not only returned to 2019 levels but actually increased.\\nU.S. general imports of textiles and apparel increased by $16.9 billion (13.3 percent) to $144.6 billion in 2021.[6] Imports of products within all digests in the textiles and apparel sector grew except miscellaneous textile products. Imports of apparel, home furnishings, fabrics, carpets and rugs, and fibers and yarns grew by double-digit rates in 2021 as the U.S. industry began to recover from the initial COVID-19 pandemic-related slowdown and U.S. consumer spending increased from 2020 levels.[7] The largest digest group, apparel, which accounted for over 70 percent of all textile and apparel imports in 2021, saw the largest increase by value, $21.8 billion (27.3 percent), followed by home furnishings and fabrics (increases of $3.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively).\\nU.S. Domestic Exports\\nU.S. exports of textiles and apparel increased by $2.7 billion (18.5 percent) to $17.4 billion in 2021.[8] Apparel, fibers and yarns, miscellaneous textile products, and fabrics led the growth in U.S exports in this sector. The two largest exported product groups were fabrics ($5.5 billion) and fibers and yarns ($4.0 billion), together accounting for over one-half of all U.S. textile and apparel exports. The largest destination markets for U.S. textiles and apparel were Mexico, Canada, and Honduras, which accounted for 57.2 percent of all U.S. exports in 2021. The growth in U.S. exports was driven by downstream demand from apparel and textile product consumers that, in turn, spurred demand for U.S. fibers, yarns, and fabrics from producers in regional trade partner countries.[9]\\nU.S. exports of apparel saw the largest shift by value, increasing $780 million (31.2 percent) to $3.3 billion.[10] A little over 50 percent of U.S. exports of apparel in 2021 went to Canada and Mexico as supply chain disruptions incentivized local and regional sourcing to avoid long lead times.[11] The United States exports a wide range of apparel with the largest single product being knitted or crocheted parts of garments or of clothing accessories, which rose by $204 million to $399 million in 2021.\\nU.S. exports of fibers and yarns saw the second-largest increase of $773 million (23.8 percent) to $4.0 billion in 2021.[12] Certain cotton and synthetic yarns accounted for five of the six-largest exported fibers and yarns products, the largest recipients of which were Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) countries, including Honduras, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala.[13] CAFTA-DR rules of origin stipulate that most inputs used in apparel and other finished textiles traded under the agreement be produced in the member countries.[14] The growth in U.S. exports of upstream textile products such as fiber, yarn, and fabric was driven by rising consumer spending for downstream textile products.[15] U.S. exports also benefited from public and private efforts to support the textiles supply chain within the Western Hemisphere, specifically between the United States and the Northern Triangle region of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. For example, in 2021, at least seven U.S. companies announced investments in U.S.- and CAFTA-member textile manufacturing facilities in an effort to increase textiles trade within the region.[16]\\nExports of miscellaneous textile products increased by $544 million (18.7 percent) to $3.5 billion in 2021.[17] Worn clothing and other worn articles accounted for the largest share (23.5 percent) of all miscellaneous textile exports, and exports of these products grew by 35.3 percent ($213 million) between 2020 and 2021.[18] The United States is the largest global exporter of worn clothing,[19] and the increase in exports is tied to the value of apparel sales. That is, as U.S. consumers purchased more clothing in 2021, people disposed of more clothing as well, resulting in an increase in worn clothing exports.[20] The second-most exported miscellaneous textile product group included N95 respirators and other textile face masks.[21] While exports of these goods climbed 40.0 percent between 2019 and 2020, exports fell by 1.4 percent in 2021 as most personal protective equipment (PPE) made in the United States was used domestically.[22]\\nFabric exports also grew in 2021, increasing by $534 million (10.9 percent) to $5.5 billion. Fabrics made up the largest share of U.S. exports of textiles and apparel products, accounting for 31.1 percent, and within the fabrics digest, nonwoven fabrics made up the largest category of exported products. These fabrics are critical inputs to produce many PPE products, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, and other medical PPE.[23] Mexico and Canada were the largest destination markets for U.S. exports of fabric, valued at $2.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.\\nRe-exports made up 21.8 percent ($4.8 billion) of total U.S. textile and apparel product exports in 2021.[24] Within the apparel digest, re-exports accounted for a larger share, 46.8 percent, of total apparel exports in 2021, slightly lower than 48.9 percent in 2020. The share of apparel re-exports is larger than other textile re-exports as many U.S. apparel brands and retailers use free trade zones (FTZs) as distribution hubs for their products.[25]\\nU.S. General Imports\\nU.S. general imports of textiles and apparel increased by $16.9 billion (13.3 percent) to $144.6 billion in 2021.[26] Imports of products under all digests within the textiles and apparel sector grew except miscellaneous textile products.[27] Imports of apparel, home furnishings, fabrics, carpets and rugs, and fibers and yarns all grew by double-digit rates in 2021, as U.S. consumer spending rose and companies worked to sell excess inventories from 2020 to meet increased demand.[28] The largest digest group, apparel, which accounted for 70.2 percent of all textile and apparel imports, saw the largest increase of $21.8 billion (27.3 percent).[29] Apparel imports increased to above pre-pandemic levels, rising from $92.6 billion in 2019 to $101.5 billion in 2021, reflecting increased consumer demand as many people returned to pre-pandemic activities after COVID-19 vaccines became available.[30] Imports of home furnishings ($15.4 billion) and fabrics ($8.1 billion) also grew by 33.0 and 17.9 percent, respectively, as consumers continued to prioritize spending on household goods in 2021.[31]\\nU.S. imports of textiles and apparel from China, the largest U.S. supplier of textiles and apparel in 2021, decreased by $4.8 billion (9.5 percent) to $45.4 billion. China accounted for a little less than one-third of all U.S. imports and was the largest U.S. supplier of products within each digest except carpet and rugs. Due to the decline in U.S. imports from China, China’s share of total U.S. imports fell from 39.3 percent to 31.4 percent, which was slightly below China’s 2019 share of 33.7 percent. This decline was driven by the steep drop in U.S. imports of face masks from China, which fell by at least $13.1 billion (74.0 percent) in 2021 to $4.6 billion as U.S. demand was primarily met with domestic supply.[32] In contrast, U.S. imports of apparel from China increased by $4.7 billion (19.9 percent) in 2021.\\nCompanies identified multiple challenges with respect to sourcing textiles and apparel from China in 2021. For example, imports from China continued to incur additional duties under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, making the cost of Chinese goods relatively more expensive compared to goods of other countries.[33] In addition, goods produced in the Xinjiang region of China, where 20 percent of the world’s cotton is grown, were banned from U.S. importation under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.[34] Finally, some apparel retailers sourcing from China indicated that they were looking to diversify their sourcing portfolio to include other Asian countries, citing rising costs of production in China.[35] However, this transition has been slow due to limited manufacturing capacity in other countries and U.S. retailers’ established supply chains with Chinese suppliers.[36]\\nVietnam was the second-largest U.S. supplier of textiles and apparel in 2021, making up 11.1 percent of all U.S. imports. Apparel accounted for most U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from Vietnam (93.1 percent), and imports increased by $1.7 billion (12.7 percent) in 2021 to $14.9 billion. Vietnam is a large sourcing hub for many U.S. apparel importers, but multiple factors mitigated larger growth of U.S. apparel imports from Vietnam in 2021. For example, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation into Vietnam’s acts, policies, and practices related to the valuation of its currency.[37] While no additional duties were placed on imports from Vietnam as a result of this investigation, firms expressed concerns over Vietnam’s sourcing costs.[38] In addition to sourcing costs, Vietnam experienced challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many apparel manufacturers shut down due to public safety concerns after cases increased from May to September of 2021, resulting in labor shortages as workers left big cities during the slowdown.[39] Despite these challenges, Vietnam continues to be an attractive apparel supplier to the United States due to its diversified product offerings, strong regional value chain, and comparatively high worker productivity rates.[40]\\nIndia was the third-largest supplier of textiles and apparel to the U.S. market in 2021, with imports increasing by $3.4 billion (44.9 percent) to $11.1 billion. About 40 percent ($4.5 billion) of U.S. imports from India were apparel and another 40 percent ($4.7 billion) were composed of home furnishings and carpets and rugs. India is a major producer of home textiles.[41] The country ranked as the second-largest U.S. supplier of home furnishings and fabric, and the largest supplier of carpets and rugs. U.S. demand for home furnishings, such as bedding, grew in 2021 as consumers maintained enthusiasm for purchasing home textiles that began during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.[42]\\nThe three next-largest U.S. suppliers of textiles and apparel—Bangladesh, Mexico, and Malaysia—all saw increased U.S. import shares in 2021, supplying 5.2 percent, 4.3 percent, and 4.1 percent of total U.S. sector imports, respectively. Nearly all imports (95.3 percent) from Bangladesh were apparel, valued at $7.2 billion in 2021, an increase of 35.7 percent. Mexico supplied primarily apparel, miscellaneous textile products, and home furnishings in 2021. U.S. imports from Mexico increased by nearly 20 percent to $6.3 billion, and its share of total U.S. imports rose slightly from 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent. U.S. imports of apparel from Malaysia also grew in 2021, increasing from $2.9 billion in 2020 to $5.9 billion in 2021. This shift was driven by an increase in total U.S. imports of medical gloves, which grew 191.2 percent from $2.6 billion to $7.6 billion during 2020–21, and of which Malaysia accounted for over one-half of total U.S. imports ($4.3 billion).[43] Disposable gloves were categorized as critical PPE in the defense against COVID-19 and have been in high global demand since the beginning of the pandemic.[44]\\n\\n[1] The Textiles and Apparel sector consists of six product digests.

For example, U.S. domestic exports of fibers and yarns increased by $773 million (23.8 percent) to $4.0 billion in 2021, but exports were still 7.8 percent lower than exports in 2019, which totaled $4.4 billion.\\n[6] USITC DataWeb/Census, digests TX001–006, accessed February 15, 2022.\\n[7] Friedman, “Retail Imports to Show,” December 9, 2021; USDOC, BEA, “Personal Consumption Expenditures,” January 27, 2022, table 2.3.1.\\n[8] USITC DataWeb/Census, digests TX001–006, accessed February 15, 2022.\\n[9] In particular, technical textiles and home furnishings experienced increased demand for U.S. textile inputs.

Industry\\n\\n\\nRapid Impact Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\nRapid Impact Analysis - 4 March 2025\\nUS Auto Tariffs: Disruption Hits North American Industry\\n\\nBy Stephanie Brinley\\n\\nArticle Summary\\nUS auto tariffs will profoundly impact automotive production and sales in North America; production impacted by as much as 20,000 units per day within a week.\\n\\nNegotiations and Delays\\nCustoms and Duty Changes\\nProbability of Scenarios\\nSummary\\n\\nS&P Global Mobility's\\xa0AutoIntelligence service provides daily analysis of global automotive news and events, including the\\xa0automotive industry forecast. We deliver timely context and impactful analysis for navigating the fast-moving industry. Behind the Headlines offers a bi-weekly dive into recent top stories.\\nHighlights\\n\\nUS imposed 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico; 10% additional tariff on China.\\nCanada issues retaliatory tariff.\\nChina issues retaliatory non-autos tariff.\\nMexico response expected.\\nPotential for immediate North American production impact of 20,000 units per day.\\n\\nThe stability of the North American automotive ecosystem saw an existential threat turn to action on February 1, 2025. That day, US President Trump signed three Executive Orders regarding trade structures with major new tariffs to be enacted with effect from 12:01 am EST, Tuesday, February 4, on Canada, Mexico and mainland China. These include auto tariffs that will profoundly impact automotive production and sales in North America.\\nBy late afternoon of Feb 3, negotiations with both Mexico and Canada enabled their tariffs to be delayed by a month, while the 10% tariff on goods from mainland China were imposed.\\nNone of the three countries were able to negotiate further delay and on March 4, 2025, the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect. Imports from China are now assessed with an additional 10%, bringing the tariffs under this action to 20%. The only adjustment is that Canadian energy (oil and natural gas) are tariffed at 10% instead of 25%.\\nThese tariffs were to be applied in addition to any current tariffs, which for China includes some products tariffed at most favored nation (MFN) 2.5%, automotive products at 25% already and electric vehicles at 100%.\\nCanada countered with a 25% tariff on an immediate CA$30 billion in US goods, with another CA$125 billion in additional goods tariff planned to come in force 21 days later. Canada had also held off on those tariffs in February, but has implemented them as of March 4 as well.\\nPresident Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Act gives the president broad leeway to assess tariffs under a national emergency, without Congressional approval. Trump declared illegal immigration and smuggling of illicit drugs, fentanyl in particular, as national emergencies, formally identifying the national emergency these tariffs were to address.\\n\\nNegotiations and Delays\\nMexico and Canada negotiated the delay from Feb 4 to March 4 by increasing their activity to stop illegal migration and drug smuggling at their borders. Mexico’s President Sheinbaum agreed to 10,000 troops of the Mexican national guard to patrol the border. Canada’s subsequent agreement echoed the move from Mexico, though Canada’s plan is more robust, more detailed and included a commitment for a CA$1.3 billion investment into improving border security and illicit fentanyl trade.\\nCustoms and Duty Changes\\nAlong with imposing tariffs, a de minimis exemption was set aside on Feb 4. The exemption had meant packages with self-reported value under $800 could be imported without duty; setting it aside immediately caused chaos at customs centers and ports not prepared to deal with the additional volume of packages to\\xa0be tracked and assessed, and de minimus was restored.\\nOn March 3, President Trump addressed this issue, saying the exemption will be lifted as soon as the Commerce Secretary has developed and is ready to implement procedures to handle the workflow. Consumer goods from mainland China will be most severely impacted by this change.\\nAnother key change with these tariffs is that there will be no ‘duty drawback’ integrated into the Canada and Mexico tariffs. Credit for US content in a Canada or Mexico-built vehicle will not be factored into duty calculations; duty will be determined on final vehicle value.\\nProbability of Scenarios\\n70% Probability: A Quick Resolution\\nNow that the 25% tariff scenario has been deployed, we see a 70% probability for a quick resolution. In that case, we would see the tariffs only in effect for 0-2 weeks.\\xa0 We will see some automaker production lost due to supply issues and border gridlock, and short-term OEM production halts. In this scenario, we expect that all lost sales and production is regained in short order.\\nS&P Global Mobility estimates that there are about 63,900 light vehicles produced per day across North America, with 41,700 units produced in the US, 17,600 units in Mexico and 4,600 units in Canada. We estimate that production disruption caused by the tariffs could result in one-third of production being disrupted in the region within one week. This would equate to disruption of more than 20,000 units per day in short order.\\n20% Probability: Extended Disruption\\nHowever, we also see potential for an Extended Disruption if the tariffs are held in place for a six-to-eight-week duration. We see a 20% probability for this outcome. In this case, we will see several high exposure vehicles slow or cease production and for OEMs to conserve inventory and be careful to replenish with ‘tariffed’ stock. OEMs will look to protect profitability by replenishing slowly and keep incentives and discounts very low while aiming to keep pricing strong. We do see potential for product development delays during this period having a knock-on effect into future years. Slowed product development will mean that product launches in later years will be delayed, having impact in some years after this has passed. However, with a six-to-eight-week disruption, we expect most sales and production are compensated for within 12 months.\\n10% Scenario: Tariff Winter\\nThe more dire scenario is a Tariff Winter. S&P Global Mobility currently puts this at a 10% probability. In this case, tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada are integrated long-term into the auto trade structures. This would create an environment of sub-optimal sourcing--vehicles and components produced in Mexico and Canada are currently in those locations because cost and efficiencies are optimal in this arrangement. Moving that production to the US to avoid the tariff also increases the cost of labor for manufacturing, has the potential to further exacerbate a general labor shortage, and could leave automakers with underutilized plants in Mexico or Canada. Though in a Tariff Winter we would expect to see re-sourcing, due to the sub-optimal sourcing increasing the cost of manufacturing, North American light-vehicle sales could decline by 10% for several years with a long-term decline in competitiveness. The decline is likely to be 10% in the US, 8% in Mexico and 15% in Canada.\\nA key issue here is that OEMs and suppliers will only invest capital and resources if there is long-term stability in the trade and source planning environment; a Tariff Winter presumes some level of stability, even at higher costs. In the meantime, the uncertain trade situation may delay development of future vehicle programs. This is particularly true in light of additional emission and fuel economy regulation uncertainty.\\nSummary\\nNow that tariff against Canada and Mexico has been imposed, it will significantly disrupt the economics of the region. S&P Global Mobility sees potential for North American production to be impacted by as much as 20,000 units per day within a week. We do expect to see announcements from automakers regarding potential sourcing considerations which were in the works prior to the tariffs being announced. We may see other changes as well; as example, reports indicate that Honda is re-evaluating a previous plan to add production of the next-generation Civic to its Mexico plant in 2027 and source from the US instead.\\nA full-length analysis is available to AutoIntelligence and AutoTechInsight subscribers through their respective web portals.\\nPlan ahead for any possible scenario with S&P Global Mobility's scenario planning consulting services.\\nInquire About Our Scenarios Planning Support\\nThis article w__as published by S&P Global Mobility and not by S&P Global Ratings, which is a separately managed division of S&P Global.\\n\\nContent Type\\nArticles\\n\\nThemes\\nAutomotive Industry Forecast\\n\\nSeries\\nBehind the Headlines\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSales & Support\\n\\nAmericas\\n+1 800 516 2021\\nAsia Pacific\\n+60 4 296 1126\\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\\n\\n+44 (0) 203 367 0682\\n\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\nOverview\\nNews Releases\\nQuarterly Earnings\\n\\nSEC Filings & Reports\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nCustomer Care & Sales\\nSupport by Division\\nReport an Ethics Concern\\n\\nOffice Locations\\n\\n\\nOur Organization\\n\\nCareers\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nLeadership\\nIOSCO ESG Rating & Data Product Statements\\n\\n\\nCookie Settings\\n\\nTerms of Use\\nCookie Notice\\nPrivacy Policy\\nClient Privacy Portal\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\\n© 2025 S&P Global\\n\", 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 0.02}\n"

Those tariffs will hit foreign brands as well as American ones, like Ford Motor and General Motors, which build some of their vehicles in Canada or Mexico.\\nNearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as well as nearly 60 percent of the parts in vehicles assembled in the United States. That means the tariffs could push up car prices significantly when inflation has already made cars and trucks more expensive for American consumers.\\nDuring remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said the tariffs would encourage auto companies and their suppliers to set up shop in the United States.\\n“Anybody who has plants in the United States, it’s going to be good for,” he said.\\nBut the auto industry is global and has been built up around trade agreements that allow factories in different countries to specialize in certain parts or types of cars, with the expectation that they would face little to no tariffs. That has been particularly true for North America, where national auto sectors have been stitched together by trade agreements since the 1960s.\\nMexico is the largest source of vehicle imports in the United States, followed by Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany.\\nStock markets fell on news that the auto tariffs would be imposed. Shares of major carmakers tumbled further in after-hours trading, after the White House clarified that the tariffs would also cover imported auto parts. General Motors was down nearly 7 percent and Ford and Stellantis were more than 4 percent lower after the markets closed. Tesla’s stock fell 1 percent in extended trading.\\nMr. Trump argues that the tariffs will increase domestic auto production, but it’s not clear how fast he can accomplish that goal. Tariffs can encourage companies to use more products from the United States and expand production, but new factories typically take several years and can cost billions of dollars to construct.\\nThe additional costs that tariffs will introduce could also backfire economically, harming the U.S. auto industry by squeezing its profits and slowing its sales.\\nThe measure could also set off more trade clashes with foreign countries that send many cars to the United States. And it could invite retaliation on American exports, including cars and agricultural products.\\nPeter Navarro, the senior counselor to the president on trade and manufacturing, told reporters Wednesday that “foreign trade cheaters have turned America into a lower-wage assembly operation for foreign parts.” He added, “That threatens our national security because it’s eroded our defense and manufacturing industrial base.”\\nMr. Navarro singled out countries including Germany, Japan and South Korea, saying they had undermined the ability of U.S. companies to sell their cars abroad. “It’s simply, simply not fair, and that’s going to change,” he said.\\nSome groups praised the tariffs. In a statement, the president of the United Auto Workers union, Shawn Fain, said the tariffs would “end the free-trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades.”\\n“Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions,” he said.\\nBut others said the auto tariffs would hurt the United States as well as other countries.\\n“Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role,” Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said. “This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”\\nThe tariffs have the potential to devastate auto and auto parts manufacturing in Canada, which employs about 125,000 people directly and accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s manufacturing output. About 80 to 90 percent of Canadian production is exported.\\nCanada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, called the announcement “a direct attack,” and said that because of the tariffs the historic ties between Canada and the United States “are in the process of being broken.” Mr. Carney said he would gather his cabinet on Thursday to determine what steps Canada would take in response.\\nThe situation is similarly dire in Mexico, where automotive manufacturing accounts for about 5 percent of the country’s economic activity and employs about one million people, according to Capital Economics.\\nGeneral Motors manufactures some of its Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks in Mexico. Toyota’s Tacoma pickup and two Stellantis models, the Ram pickup and Jeep Compass sport utility vehicle, are also made there. Factories in Canada make the Silverado, Toyota’s RAV4 sport utility vehicle, the Honda CR-V and other popular models.\\nThe administration said the 25 percent tariff would apply to both cars and car parts made in Canada and Mexico, despite the U.S. trade agreement signed with those nations. It created a small exception to those levies, saying any content or materials that originated in the United States but were incorporated into cars finished in Canada and Mexico would be exempt.\\nOtherwise, White House officials indicated that there would be no exemptions, and Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he expected the tariffs to be permanent.\\nGiven the size and importance of the auto industry, the effect of the tariffs will cascade through the economy.\\nAbout one million Americans are employed by auto and parts manufacturers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and two million more are employed at dealers that sell cars and parts. And cars are often the single biggest purchase for American families, meaning that additional costs from tariffs could weigh heavily on consumers.\\nMr. Trump’s decision to impose car tariffs escalates his aggressive trade approach. Since coming into office, he has put an additional 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports from China. He also imposed a 25 percent tariff on almost all goods from Canada and Mexico, before exempting roughly half of those imports, which trade under the rules of the North American trade agreement.\\nMr. Trump plans to introduce more levies next Wednesday, when, he has said, he will announce “reciprocal tariffs” that match the high tariffs and other trade barriers that other countries impose on American exports. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the tariffs would be “very fair” and “very nice.”\\n“We’re going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised.”\\nMr. Trump’s car tariffs will be imposed under an old trade case from his first term, which used a national-security-related legal authority known as Section 232. In 2019, his administration carried out an investigation into car imports and concluded that they threatened national security.\\nIn a presidential proclamation on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the national security concerns had only “escalated” since then. He said revisions he had made in his first term to U.S. trade agreements with South Korea, Canada and Mexico “had not yielded sufficient positive outcomes.”\\nIn a call with reporters on Wednesday, a White House representative rebutted concerns that the auto tariffs could result in a major uptick in car prices, pointing to Mr. Trump’s push to secure a new tax deduction for interest payments on auto loans, which would be limited to American cars.\\nBut most analysts have predicted sharp price increases from tariffs. Before the details were announced, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, estimated that a 25 percent tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada would add $3,000 even to the cost of a car built in the United States, since automakers depend on many foreign components.\\nTariffs would add $6,000 on average to the prices of cars made in Mexico or Canada, a category that includes vehicles like the Toyota Tacoma pickup, gasoline and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox, and several models of Ram pickups, according to Cox estimates.\\nMr. Smoke said higher prices would deter buyers and force automakers to curtail production. He estimated that U.S. factories would produce 20,000 fewer cars per week, or about 30 percent less than usual.\\n“By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Mr. Smoke said Wednesday on a conference call with clients and reporters. “Bottom line: lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”\\nThere could be a temporary benefit for companies, including Ford, Hyundai and Stellantis, that have large numbers of unsold vehicles on dealer lots. Vehicle shortages caused by tariffs will allow them to clear inventory without cutting prices. But the benefit would be short-lived.\\nCarmakers may be able to blunt some of the impact from tariffs because they have designed factories to produce different models on the same assembly line.\\n“Changes in production are always an option,” said Jörg Burzer, a member of the management board at Mercedes-Benz who oversees production at the German automaker.\\nBut it will not be possible for Mercedes to completely avoid the impact of tariffs, which will add substantially to the prices for new cars. Tariffs “would definitely add to the cost, that’s clear,” Mr. Burzer said in an interview in Berlin last week.\\nIn an effort to appease the Trump administration, some foreign carmakers have pledged to expand their manufacturing operations in the United States.\\nHyundai Motor said during an event with Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday that it would invest $21 billion in the United States over the next four years. The South Korean company, which already has large factories in Georgia and Alabama, said the new investments would include a factory in Louisiana to produce steel for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis cars.\\nMercedes, which produces S.U.V.s in Alabama, plans to expand its U.S. operations, Ola Källenius, its chief executive, said in an interview in Rome this month. “We are 100 percent committed to the United States and will continue to be so and are poised to do more,” he said, without giving specifics.\\nSimon Romero, Ian Austen and River Akira Davis contributed reporting.\\nShow more\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 10:05 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nTony Romm\\nTrump says he could cut Chinese tariffs in exchange for a TikTok deal.\\nImage\\n\\nPresident Trump said he could issue another order that grants the government additional time to find a buyer for TikTok. Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times\\nPresident Trump on Wednesday raised the possibility that he could relax steep upcoming tariffs on China in exchange for the country’s support on a deal to sell TikTok to a new owner supported by the United States.\\nAcknowledging that Beijing is “going to have to play a role” in any transaction, Mr. Trump signaled to reporters at the White House that he could be open to negotiation. “Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,” he said.\\nUnder a law enacted before Mr. Trump took office, the Chinese-based parent company of TikTok must either sell the social media app’s U.S. operations or face what essentially amounts to a domestic ban. Lawmakers adopted that policy in response to growing, bipartisan concerns that the app posed threats to U.S. national security, which TikTok denies.\\nCongress originally set a January deadline for its ultimatum. But no sale occurred, prompting Mr. Trump — as one of his first executive actions — to delay enforcement of the law for 75 days in the hopes of securing a buyer.\\nThe new deadline arrives on April 5, just three days after Mr. Trump separately plans to announce what he has described as “reciprocal” tariffs, imposing new duties on foreign nations based on the trade barriers that they erect to U.S. imports. The president has already subjected Chinese goods to a 20 percent tariff, on top of those he enacted during his first term in office.\\n“Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok,” Mr. Trump said about the prospects of a negotiation, adding: “Sounds like something I’d do.”\\nMr. Trump said on Wednesday that he could issue another order that granted the government additional time to find a buyer for TikTok, stressing that the goal is an outcome “that’s best for our country.” The president has raised the possibility that the U.S. government could acquire a stake in the app.\\n“If it’s not finished, it’s not a big deal. We’ll extend it,” Mr. Trump said.\\nChinese officials maintain that any sale or divestiture must comply with local export laws, potentially giving Beijing power over any arrangement brokered by Mr. Trump.\\nShow more\\nTracking Trump’s Tariffs\\n\\nPlanned\\nIn effect\\nPartly in effect\\nPaused\\n\\nJan. 20\\nFeb.\\nMarch\\n\\n\\nMexico\\nMost goods\\n\\n\\nCanada\\nMost goods\\n\\n\\nChina\\nAll goods\\n\\n\\nWorld\\nAluminum\\n\\n\\nWorld\\nSteel\\n\\n\\nWorld\\nReciprocal\\n\\n\\nWorld\\nCars\\n\\n\\nNote: Goods imported from Mexico and Canada covered under the USMCA trade pact received a temporary reprieve from new tariffs.\\nAdvertisement\\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 7:52 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nIan Austen\\nReporting from Ottawa\\nThe tariffs have the potential to devastate the entire auto-making and auto parts-making industry in Canada. It employs about 500,000 people, and accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s manufacturing gross domestic product. About 80 to 90 percent of Canada’s production is exported, and since an auto trade deal in 1965 Canadian factories have been scaled to supply the U.S. market. It would be difficult, likely impossible, to operate existing factories only for the Canadian market.\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 7:36 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nJack Ewing\\nCovers the auto industry\\nThe United Automobile Workers union endorsed the tariffs, saying the decision “signals a return to policies that prioritize the workers who build this country — rather than the greed of ruthless corporations.” Shawn Fain, the union president, said in a statement that “ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 7:36 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nJack Ewing\\nCovers the auto industry\\nBut the union, which has often been at odds with the president, also warned against any efforts by the administration to weaken labor rights, cut social security benefits or Medicare and Medicaid.\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 7:18 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nJack Ewing\\nCovers the auto industry\\nTariffs could give Tesla and Musk an advantage over their rivals.\\nImage\\n\\nA shopper outside the Tesla store on Santana Row, an upscale outdoor shopping center in San Jose, Calif., last year.Credit...Rachel Bujalski for The New York Times\\nTesla could be a winner from the auto tariffs announced by President Trump on Wednesday — or at least suffer less than its competitors.\\nTesla, whose chief executive, Elon Musk, has taken a leading role in the Trump administration, makes all the cars that it sells in the United States in California and Texas. That means that Tesla vehicles will not be subject to tariffs, although the company will still see its production costs rise because of tariffs on imported parts.\\nTesla’s Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan were the two best-selling electric vehicles in the United States last year. But the company has been losing market share to vehicles like General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox E.V. and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E.\\nBoth of those electric cars are made in Mexico and will become significantly more expensive because they have more imported parts than Tesla cars. The precise impact is unclear because the administration says any U.S. content in cars assembled in Mexico or Canada will be exempt from tariffs.\\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that Mr. Musk had not influenced his decision to impose tariffs. “He’s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,” Mr. Trump said at the White House.\\nAll automakers, including Tesla, import motors, batteries, raw materials and other parts from other countries. Those components will be subject to tariffs, raising prices across the board. Parts from Canada and Mexico will be granted a temporary reprieve from tariffs until the Trump administration can calculate and exempt from tariffs the U.S. content of each part.\\nAnalysts and industry executives were still calculating the financial impact. But it is likely that the tariffs will severely disrupt supply chains and lead to production cutbacks and layoffs.\\nImage\\n\\nFord F-150 pickup trucks for sale at a dealership in Austin, Texas, on Monday.Credit...Brandon Bell/Getty Images\\nCar prices could rise by thousands of dollars. Analysts at Bernstein said the tariffs would add as much as $75 billion per year to automaker costs, which they would have to pass on to car buyers.\\nAlready, many Americans cannot afford to buy new cars. The tariffs will push lower-priced models like the Chevrolet Trax, which is made in South Korea, even further out of reach for middle-income buyers.\\n“The folks at the lower end of the buying pool are going to suffer the most,” said Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.\\nIn the pickup market, one of the industry’s most profitable segments, Ford Motor could have an advantage over rivals. The company makes its F-series pickups at several U.S. factories. Toyota, General Motors and Ram, a division of Stellantis, build significant numbers of pickups in Mexico.\\nVirtually all major automakers have factories in the United States, allowing them to produce at least some cars not subject to tariffs on the finished product. BMW produces in South Carolina; Toyota in Kentucky and several other states; Nissan in Tennessee; Mercedes-Benz in Alabama; and Honda in Indiana and Ohio.\\nHyundai on Wednesday inaugurated a new factory in Georgia where it will produce electric vehicles. The South Korean company also produces cars in Alabama.\\nBut Hyundai, Toyota and the German carmakers also import hundreds of thousands of cars from Asia and Europe, which will be subject to 25 percent tariffs.\\nVolkswagen could be among the hardest hit. It produces the Atlas S.U.V. and ID.4 electric vehicle in Chattanooga, Tenn., but depends on Mexican factories for models like the Jetta sedan. VW’s Audi division also produces in Mexico for U.S. customers and imports cars from Europe. Porsche, which is also part of Volkswagen, imports all its cars from Europe.\\nThe tariffs could make it even harder for Volkswagen to sell more cars in the United States where it has long struggled to expand.\\nShow more\\nAdvertisement\\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 7:06 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nSimon Romero\\nReporting from Mexico City\\nThe tariffs could affect an array of vehicles that are popular in the United States and manufactured in Mexico.

The United States is the most important export market for Germany’s auto industry.Credit...Laetitia Vancon for The New York Times\\nAfter months of threats, the White House unveiled plans on Wednesday to impose tariffs on automobiles imported to the United States, a plan that is likely to hit car companies across the European Union hard.\\nThe move — which would place a 25 percent tariff on all cars not built in the United States — could ramp up pressure on Europe to respond with countermeasures.\\nEuropean Union officials have already announced plans to allow tariffs that were instituted during President Trump’s first term to snap back into place, and have said they will place a new set of tariffs on a wide variety of American goods — from lingerie to soy products — by mid-April.\\nBut those measures were a response to steel and aluminum tariffs. And their first wave, meant to hit American whiskey and motorcycles, was delayed to allow for more negotiating time and over fears of a stark American response that could crush European wine and Champagne exports.\\nThe latest U.S. move may intensify the urgency for the European Union to retaliate. Automotive tariffs could squeeze an industry that is already vulnerable — especially in Europe’s biggest economy, Germany, which sends American consumers cars from companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. That makes the tariffs a serious escalation in a trade war that has already left Europe scrambling.\\n“I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on European automotive exports,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said in a statement on Wednesday.\\nThe European Union will “assess this announcement, together with other measures the U.S. is envisaging in the next days,” she added, and will “continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.”\\nThe United States is the European Union’s largest export market for cars, accounting for nearly a quarter of all its exported vehicles.\\nIn 2024, European automakers sent 38.4 billion euros’ worth of cars across the Atlantic, down 4.6 percent from the previous year, according to the European automobile makers association, ACEA.\\nAuto tariffs “will definitely be a big bummer for the recently returned optimism in Europe,” said Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro for ING Research. In particular, they could “hurt German exports and increase chances of a continued stagnation.”\\nThe biggest three German carmakers make up about 73 percent of the European Union’s automotive exports to the United States, according to the research firm JATO Dynamics.\\nAnd the United States is the most important export market for Germany’s auto industry. Nearly one of every three Porsches is exported to the United States, while one of every six BMWs is shipped there. Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi (a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group) have production sites in the United States and Mexico, but they would be hard hit by the increase in tariffs.\\nBMW warned this month that it expected that the growing trade conflicts would cost the company $1 billion this year.\\n“If you overdo it with tariffs, it sends a negative spiral to all market participants,” Oliver Zipse, the chairman of BMW, told Bloomberg. There are “no winners in that game.”\\nCars are just one sector facing steep tariff increases. On top of the tariffs on steel and aluminum, the United States is planning to announce what the administration calls “reciprocal” tariffs next Wednesday.\\nThe goal of those, the administration says, is to equalize tariff rates between various nations and America.\\nMaros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Commission, and Bjoern Seibert, the head of cabinet for the commission’s president, visited Washington on Tuesday to talk to their American counterparts — Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative.\\nOn Wednesday, European ambassadors heard an account of those meetings, according to three diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.\\nThe takeaway was that reciprocal tariffs could be in the double digits, two of the diplomats said — perhaps even 20 percent or higher, one added, though the figure was uncertain and the range of estimates wide. The tariffs would apply across the board for E.U. countries.\\n“The EU’s priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs,” Mr. Sefcovic said on X after his meetings this week. “We share the goal of industrial strength on both sides.”\\nAlthough the European Union has a relatively low tariff rate on average, the United States has signaled that it will take other factors into account when calculating reciprocal tariffs — including value-added taxes. Those are consumption taxes added to a good or service at each stage of production, and they are given back to the exporter if a product is exported. Mr. Trump has been a longtime critic of those policies.\\nMr. Trump said while announcing the auto tariffs on Wednesday that the coming reciprocal tariffs would be “lenient” and that “we’re going to be very fair.” He offered few concrete details.\\nA correction was made on\\xa0\\nMarch 26, 2025\\n:\\xa0\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the value of the cars that European automakers sent across the Atlantic last year.

REUTERS/Imelda Medina/File Photo\\nIt seems like \"tariff\" is the word of the moment. Early in his second term, President Donald Trump initially implemented 10% tariffs on goods coming in from China, with an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports coming a few weeks later. Today, he is imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada.\\nThe tariffs will remain in place indefinitely at the President\\'s discretion and may increase if other nations retaliate. There are also threats of tariffs on European imports. All of these tariffs apply to vehicles built in these three countries and to the parts imported from those countries to be used in vehicles that are assembled in the United States. The importer is responsible for paying the tariff when the item (the car, truck, SUV, or component, in this case) comes into the country. The importer, in this case a car company, could choose to absorb the cost of the tariff, but the cost will likely be passed through to consumers in the form of higher car prices.\\nAdvertisement\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nTariffs will still affect car companies that assemble vehicles in the U.S. because components and materials must be imported\\nExperts forecast sticker prices to increase an average of $3,000 per vehicle\\nSome automakers may retool factories or ramp up production in countries where the U.S. does not currently impose tariffs\\n\\nSome car companies will feel more effects from the tariffs than others, but they will all feel the pinch. \"All manufacturers are going to be impacted — even those who are building vehicles in the U.S. have some content from Canada and Mexico,\" said Michael Robinet, VP of forecast strategy for S&P Global Mobility. Of the Detroit Three, Ford assembles the fewest vehicles in other countries, with only 18% of its fleet coming from plants in Canada and Mexico. The remaining two members of this small club, General Motors and Stellantis (which owns Jeep, Dodge, and Ram), import about a third of their assembled vehicles from our neighbors to the north and south.\\nThere are several auto brands that we might still think of as \"foreign,\" but they have strong presences in North America. Honda, Kia, Mazda, Nissan, and Volkswagen all assemble vehicles in Canada and Mexico, while Volvo and its performance EV spinoff company Polestar assemble many of their vehicles in China. Four out of five Hondas built in Mexico are shipped to the U.S., and Volkswagen runs the largest automotive factory in Mexico. All of these companies will have to pay tariffs on vehicles they import from their foreign factories to sell in the U.S.\\nAdvertisement\\nWhen these imported vehicles hit dealerships, you should expect to see higher prices on the window stickers. Many experts estimate an average rise of $3,000 per vehicle. However — and this is important — it\\'s not only tariffs on entire cars, trucks, and SUVs that will drive up prices. Those tariffs apply to materials like steel and aluminum, too, which are the basic materials for building cars. The Ford F-150, to name just one model, is heavily reliant on aluminum.\\n\\n### What Tariffs Mean for Car Buyers For most people facing a short-notice threat of tariffs, the answer is probably to do nothing sudden unless you’ve already done your homework and are fully ready to pull the trigger on a purchase.Jim HenryFeb. 5, 2025\\n\\nEven vehicles that are assembled in the U.S. use parts that come from other companies. Some of these parts come from massive suppliers, such as Magna in Canada or Bosch, a German company with outposts around the globe, including China and Mexico. These companies are large enough that they may be able to absorb the costs of the tariffs rather than pass them on to the auto company.\\nTier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers provide parts like airbags, seat belts, or wire harnesses. These smaller companies might not have the cash flow to shoulder the extra 25% costs on the parts they sell to car companies for assembly in the U.S. Autoliv, a Tier 1 global supplier of safety equipment, has flatly said it cannot afford to take on the cost of tariffs. The company is based in Sweden, but it has facilities in Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as the U.S., Southeast Asia, and Europe.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThis can all seem abstract, so let\\'s look at a couple of examples. The Buick Enclave contains parts and materials made in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Its engine is manufactured in Mexico, and its transmission is made in the U.S. The Enclave\\'s final assembly is stateside, but GM (Buick\\'s parent company) will pay 25% tariffs on the engine and any foreign parts used in that final assembly.\\nThe Honda Civic sedan uses parts from the U.S. and Canada; its engine is built in the U.S., and its transmission is built in Mexico. However, its final assembly is in Canada. That is a complex mix of tariffs on a variety of imported parts as well as the final imported vehicle.\\nRelated:\\nBuying a Car With Your Tax Refund\\nUsually, there is an exemption from tariffs when parts crisscross borders during assembly, like an engine that\\'s partially assembled in the U.S., finished in Canada, and then brought back to the U.S. for final assembly. It\\'s called \"duty remission.\" But the proposed tariffs do not have allowances for duty remission, which is \"almost unheard of,\" said Robinet of S&P Global Mobility.\\nAdvertisement\\nMatt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, went further in saying, “We continue to believe that vehicles and parts that meet the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement\\'s\\xa0(USMCA\\'s) stringent\\xa0domestic and regional content requirements should be exempt from the tariff increase. Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce.”\\nFord has indicated that it can shift work to other U.S.-based plants to lessen its tariff exposure. And the Honda Civic in our example above is also made in Japan, so it\\'s possible the company could ramp up production in that tariff-free (so far) country. Robinet noted that manufacturers have been building their tariff-free inventory over the past few months while they wait to see if and when tariffs could be implemented. Those are the vehicles sitting on lots right now.\\nAdvertisement\\n### US to Announce 25% Tariff on EU Very Soon, Trump Says ReutersFeb. 26, 2025 \\nAutomakers cannot turn on a dime. Firing up an idled facility or retooling a production line takes time, which could mean fewer vehicles are built. That, in turn, could cause a backup in supply similar to what we saw during the COVID-era supply chain troubles. Lower supply further squeezes new car prices and puts pressure on the used car market, too.\\nAll of this is making it difficult to predict what will happen with the automotive market in 2025. \"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" said Gustavo Flores-Macias, professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.\\nAdvertisement\\nThanks to the USMCA, the 1965 Canada-United States Automotive Products Agreement (known as APTA), and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (known as NAFTA), \"we\\'ve had tariff-free automotive manufacturing for sixty years,\" said Robinet. Over those decades, automotive companies determined where it made sense to build parts and vehicles. Neither of those agreements is in place today, and the proposed tariffs could complicate the entire automotive landscape, no matter where a company\\'s headquarters may be.\\nAdvertisement\\nBrowse Cars\\nSmall Cars\\nMidsize Cars\\nLarge Cars\\nSUVs\\nCrossovers\\nTrucks\\nHybrids\\nVans\\n2025 Nissan ARIYAElectric\\nVolvo XC60Luxury\\nSports Cars\\nConvertibles\\nAdvertisement\\nU.S. News Best Cars Awards\\n\\nBest Cars for the Money\\nBest Cars for Families\\nBest Vehicle Brands\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSave on your monthly payments!

New steep import tariffs are scheduled to be imposed on these companies in June 2024. The issue has pitted key constituencies of the energy transition against one another. Some manufacturing groups have applauded[1] the DOC’s decision as cracking down on unfair Chinese trade practices, while some clean energy advocates have decried it for its potential to raise prices and slow solar deployments. The Solar Energy Industries Association said[2] this case unnecessarily put the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk.\\nIn this Q&A, the authors explore the potential implications of the forthcoming tariffs at a time when the US is attempting to accelerate its transition to clean energy.\\nHow did these new solar tariffs come about?\\nIn August, the Department of Commerce (DOC) published its final conclusion[3] on a controversial investigation of solar panel parts manufacturers that began in March 2022. Auxin Solar, a small California-based solar panel manufacturing company, petitioned[4] the US government, arguing that Chinese companies are skirting US tariffs on Chinese and Taiwanese solar cells and modules by effectively routing equipment through countries in Southeast Asia that are not subject to the same tariffs. The DOC investigated eight companies and concluded that five are violating the US laws. When the presidential moratorium on new solar tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia expires next June[5], imports of solar cells and modules from these five companies will be subject to the tariffs faced by Chinese solar manufacturers, with the tariff level ranging from 50 percent to 250 percent of the import value.\\nHelp us understand this decision in the context of US goals and global supply chains.\\nSolar energy accounted for 3.4 percent of total US electricity generation in 2022,[6] up from 1.3 percent five years earlier. This year, US solar installations are expected to set a record of 32 gigawatts (GW),[7] which is more than a 50 percent jump from last year. The pace of deployment likely needs to accelerate to achieve President Biden’s goal of 100 percent carbon-free electricity generation by 2035. According to a Department of Energy analysis,[8] solar energy could account for 40 percent of the US power grid in 2035, which would require annual solar capacity additions to almost double from today.\\nChina dominates the global supply chains for solar energy, with its global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeding 80 percent.[9] For instance, polysilicon wafers, which are processed to make solar cells, are almost entirely produced in China. In contrast, US manufacturers account for a small portion of the solar supply chain, and no American factories currently produce[10] solar wafers or cells at scale.\\nFor over a decade, solar supply chains have been a focus of US policy. Collectively, these measures reflect:\\n\\nConcerns about the resiliency of supply chains given the overwhelming reliance on a single country;\\nConcerns in particular about the reliance on China;\\nConcerns about unfair trade practices from foreign exporters;\\nAspirations to build a strong domestic solar manufacturing industry to serve as an important source of high-quality jobs and productivity in a decarbonizing world.\\n\\nWhere do these new tariffs fit in?\\nRecent US presidential administrations from both parties have levied tariffs on imported solar panels.\\nIn 2012,[11] the Obama administration imposed tariffs on Chinese solar manufacturers under anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. AD/CVD aims to address the competitive advantage foreign firms receive either from government subsidies or from selling products abroad at lower prices than in domestic markets. In 2015, these tariffs were amended and expanded, largely due to attempts to circumvent the 2012 tariffs. Since the imposition of the Obama-era tariffs, the share of US solar equipment imports directly from China has been almost completely phased out, with imports shifting to Southeast Asia. The recent DOC decision would expand these AD/CVD tariffs to cover imports from certain companies in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. These four countries accounted for more than 75 percent[12] of total US solar panel imports last year.\\nThe AD/CVD are just one of many categories of tariffs or import restrictions applied to Chinese solar equipment. Others include:\\n\\nTariffs under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, which enables[13] a president to impose temporary trade measures when a surge of imports threatens serious injury to a US industry. President Trump imposed these “safeguard” tariffs in 2018, although a subsequent exemption of bifacial solar panels (increasingly used in utility-scale solar) and increase in the quota that can be imported duty-free has diminished its effects.\\nTariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which enables[14] the US Trade Representative to take actions when trading partners are engaging in discriminatory or unreasonable practices that burden US commerce. President Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent[15] on solar and many other Chinese imports, and President Biden has kept these tariffs in place.\\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, signed by President Biden in 2021, which stops the import of polysilicon (the primary raw material for solar) and other products made in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China.\\n\\nWhat are the trade-offs of additional tariffs to Americans?\\nWithout commenting on the DOC ruling (which is beyond the authors’ expertise), it’s safe to say that tariffs can cut both ways. While they may improve the competitiveness of US solar manufacturers right when the domestic industry is growing from a small base—thanks to incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act—they can harm US solar developers as well, if they raise the costs of imports that are inputs to production. Moreover, often tariffs lead to retaliatory tariffs, which happened when China[16] imposed 57 percent duties on US polysilicon, following the 2012 tariffs, and the US polysilicon production plunged[17] from around 30 percent of global total in 2010 to around 10 percent by 2017.\\nFor US consumers, tariffs are essentially taxes. While their “incidence” (i.e., who bears the costs) may be split between foreign sellers and US consumers, empirical[18] evidence[19] suggests American consumers largely pay the costs. Therefore, while innovation has led to the rapid decline in the costs of solar energy, tariffs have made solar in the US more expensive than it would have been otherwise. It is difficult to isolate the effects of higher prices on deployment, but according to one study,[20] the AD/CVD tariffs alone caused US demand for solar to decline by 17 percent during the 2012 to 2018 period. Less solar in the electricity system could translate to more electricity produced by fossil fuels, and thus higher emissions.\\nWhat will be the effects of the new tariffs?\\nThe effects on solar markets of the additional tariffs next June may not be noticeable. Solar capacity that will not be subject to these additional tariffs is ramping up quickly, including in the Southeast Asian countries on which this decision focuses. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance,[21] solar manufacturers are building over 35 GW per year of wafer-making capacity (wafers are fabricated into solar cells) in Southeast Asia to avoid tariffs. This added supply will likely push down prices, counteracting the effects of the tariffs.\\nBut it should be noted that in a world without tariffs, solar panel prices would likely be lower and investments to avoid the tariffs would be invested elsewhere.\\nHow should policymakers view the broader trend reflected by these tariffs?\\nEven if the incremental effects of the DOC decision are small, it can be viewed as an expansion of a broader policy trend with large implications. The US has taken aggressive actions to diminish the role of Chinese producers in solar supply chains. The costs of solar modules are already two to three times higher[22] in the US than those in Europe. A recent study in Nature[23] estimates that cutting China out of supply chains increases solar module prices 20 to 30 percent compared to a scenario with globalized supply chains. US climate goals are premised on the strategy of making solar and other clean energy technologies cheap; all else equal, more expensive solar makes those targets more difficult to achieve.\\nThese costs may be justified by the benefits of punishing alleged trade violations, reducing dependence on China, or building more resilient supply chains. But these are important trade-offs for policymakers to consider. The implications of additional solar tariffs next June may be small, but similar trade-offs are likely to arise in future decisions given the escalating risks of geopolitical and climate crises.\\n\\nNotes\\n[1] https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/commerce-finalizes-duties-on-asian-solar-panel-makers-seen-as-skirting-china-tariffs.\\n[2] https://www.seia.org/news/commerce-departments-solar-tariff-decision-imperils-clean-energy-boom.\\n[3] https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/08/department-commerce-issues-final-determination-circumvention-inquiries.\\n[4] https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/CommerceAuxinDecision.pdf.\\n[5] https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-biden-use-executive-action-spark-stalled-solar-projects-amid-tariff-2022-06-06/.\\n[6] https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php.\\n[7] https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solar-rebound-installations-seia-record-year/693027/.\\n[8] https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-solar-futures-study-providing-blueprint-zero-carbon-grid.\\n[9] https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains.\\n[10] https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-probe-tariff-dodging-claim-against-chinese-manufacturers-11648500996?mod=hp_lista_pos5.\\n[11] https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-trade/u-s-sets-new-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-imports-idUSBRE84G19U20120517.\\n[12] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/us-china-solar-trade-probe-ruling-to-reshape-billions-in-trade.\\n[13] https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45529/5.\\n[14] Ibid.\\n[15] https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/speaking-sustainability/update-policies-at-cross-purposes-us-trade-policy-creates-cloudy-picture-for-rapid-deployment-of-solar-energy.\\n[16] https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-new-tariffs-hurt-the-u-s-solar-power-industry-1510628400.\\n[17] https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/trumps-solar-tariffs-create-far-more-losers-winners.\\n[18] https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26396/w26396.pdf.\\n[19] https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/543961/WP-22-372.pdf?sequence=1.\\n[20] Ibid.\\n[21] https://www.bnef.com/insights/31019.\\n[22] Ibid.\\n[23] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6.\\nShare\\n\\nShare\\n\\nTopics, Regions, Tags\\nGeopolitics Renewable Energy Asia + Pacific North America solar Southeast Asia\\nMeet the Authors\\nExternal Associates\\nLilly Yejin Lee\\nExternal Associate\\n\\nExperts\\nNoah Kaufman\\nSenior Research Scholar\\nClimate Change Energy Policy Finance & Economics\\n\\nGet the latest blog articles in your inbox\\nSubscribe for the latest updates in Energy Explained.\\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\\nSubscribe\\nRelated\\nMore on Energy Explained Energy Explained\\nGeopolitics\\nEnergy Issues Likely to Top the Modi-Trump Meeting Agenda\\nAs Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes his first\\xa0visit\\xa0to Washington in the second Trump administration, energy will likely take a front seat in United States-India relations.

A new ruling may make that more expensive\\n\\nBy Eric McDaniel (NPR)\\nAug. 18, 2023 3:19 p.m.\\n\\nWorkers install solar panels on a rooftop at AltaSea\\'s research and development facility at the Port of Los Angeles on April 21, 2023.\\nMario Tama / Getty Images\\nThe Department of Commerce has determined that solar panel manufacturers in four Southeast Asian countries are evading U.S. trade rules by using Chinese-sourced materials subject to tariffs without paying applicable duties. Those countries — Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia — are responsible for nearly three-quarters of solar modules imported to the United States.\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\\nBecome a Sponsor\\nThe ruling, unveiled Friday, means that new U.S. solar projects may soon be more expensive: manufacturers whose goods run afoul of Obama-era solar tariffs will be subject to additional import duties on their products.\\nThose duties, however, will not begin to be assessed until June 2024, when a waiver put in place by the Biden administration is set to expire.\\nThe cost of solar projects is incredibly important as the U.S. races to zero-out power sector greenhouse gas emissions — currently responsible for a quarter of the country\\'s total — by 2035%20(https:/www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emission).\\nThe world must limit average global warming to about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid the most dire effects of climate change. It is not currently on track to achieve that goal.\\nAlready in the United States, average summer temperatures have climbed more than two degrees since 1970 — and winter averages have warmed more than three degrees.\\n\\nSolar panels in Detroit on Nov. 16, 2022.\\nPaul Sancya / AP\\nThe investigation upended the solar industry, until Biden stepped in\\nThe Commerce Department\\'s investigation, which began in March 2022 in response to a complaint from a fledgling U.S. solar panel manufacturer, has been a major source of friction inside President Biden\\'s administration.\\nThe department\\'s inquiry contributed to a major drop in solar installation forecasts, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, as installers worried that their projects would become cost-prohibitive if the government imposed retroactive taxes or if the cost of future purchases increased.\\n\"Worst-case scenario, you can think about retroactive tariffs of up to 240%,\" Leo Azevedo, a solar procurement manager, told NPR in May 2022. \"There\\'s just too much risk to order panels right now and that\\'s just the end of it.\"\\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm weighed in on the matter during congressional testimony the same month.\\n\"At stake is the complete smothering of the investment and the jobs and the independence that we would be seeking as a nation to get our fuel from our own generation sources,\" Granholm said. \"I certainly am deeply concerned about being able to achieve the goal of getting to 100% clean electricity by 2035 if this is not resolved quickly.\"\\n\\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaks during an address at Brown University on March 15, 2022, in Providence, R.I.\\nCharles Krupa / AP\\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo insisted that her department was legally required to investigate. She said the process, conducted by career staff at the International Trade Administration, was entirely apolitical, despite its impact on the administration\\'s energy agenda.\\nBiden offers a reprieve\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\\nBecome a Sponsor\\nTwo months after the investigation began, Biden stepped in with a compromise. He allowed the investigation into trade abuses to proceed, but waived the possibility of trade duties on solar modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam until June 2024 — granting the solar industry a measure of certainty as it planned new projects while the inquiry was underway.\\nThe president also invoked the Defense Production Act to help expand American solar panel manufacturing and other clean energy technology, and directed the federal government to increase the amount of U.S.-made solar panels and clean technology products it buys.\\nThe president\\'s maneuver ultimately drew congressional backlash. A bipartisan majority passed a bill to strike the president\\'s waiver in May of this year, worried about how the move would impact American manufacturers.\\nThe president vetoed the legislation and it did not take effect.\\n\\nPresident Biden arrives to speak about clean energy at Brayton Power Station on July 20, 2022, in Somerset, Mass.\\nEvan Vucci / AP\\nThe investigation concludes\\nFriday\\'s ruling from the Commerce Department did not come as a great surprise to the solar industry. Investigators had issued a preliminary ruling in December that found four of the eight suppliers under investigation were circumventing U.S. duties on Chinese-made solar cells. The final investigation revised that finding to five of the eight suppliers.\\nThe ruling means that, in order to be exempt from U.S. duties, all solar providers in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia — including companies not specifically investigated by the Commerce Department — must self-certify that they are complying with all trade rules. Those claims are subject to potential audit.\\nSolar industry professionals have largely been hostile to the investigation.\\n\"This tariff case is bad for business and American workers,\" said Abigail Ross Hopper, head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement ahead of Friday\\'s announcement. \"More than 13 years of tariffs have failed to deliver even a fraction of the solar manufacturing investments we\\'ve seen in the last year.\"\\n\"As the clean energy industry continues to leap forward, we should be making it easier to invest, get a job and allow everyday citizens to access clean energy,\" she said.\\nToo soon to tell how the final ruling will reshape the industry\\nBiden\\'s waiver temporarily exempting the solar industry from any new costs associated with the investigations is supposed to allow installers to adjust their supply chains to ensure compliance with U.S. trade rules and buy time for the domestic solar manufacturing industry to mature.\\nDomestic solar manufacturing is set to soar over the next seven years with investments from Biden\\'s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. By 2030, the U.S. will produce 42 gigawatts of silicon-based solar panels from domestically-sourced parts, up from near-zero today.\\nBut once Biden\\'s tariff waiver expires in June 2024, costs could go up, stalling growth in the solar power industry.\\nDomestic manufacturing advocates support the Commerce Department\\'s ruling, and oppose the president\\'s waiver entirely.\\nIn an op-ed published earlier this month, Michael Stumo — who heads the pro-domestic manufacturing group Coalition for a Prosperous America — said that Biden\\'s tariff waiver will lead to more evasion of duties by manufacturers using Chinese components.\\nThe White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Commerce Department\\'s findings or whether the president would consider extending his solar tariff waiver beyond June 2024 to help domestic manufacturers.\\nCopyright 2023 NPR.

A $1 tariff leads to a $1.35 increase in the final prices.\\nTariffs protect domestic manufacturing jobs but reduce overall employment in the industry.\\nTariffs have had a net negative impact on the U.S. solar industry and environment by slowing deployment.\\nTariffs aim to protect domestic firms but increase prices for consumers.\\nA tariff or duty is a tax imposed on imported goods (U.S. International Trade Administration (U.S. ITA)). Trade policies such as antidumping and countervailing (AD/CV) duties aim to protect domestic industries from unfair foreign trade practices, such as selling products at below normal value (dumping) and foreign government subsides (countervailing) (U.S. Custom and Border Protection 2024). In the solar industry, the U.S. imposed AD/CV duties on Chinese solar cells and panels in 2012 (U.S. ITA 2012). In 2014, tariffs were expanded to solar panels assembled using Chinese or Taiwanese cells regardless of country of origin (U.S. ITA 2014, 2015). In 2018, a 30% tariff was imposed on all major solar product exporters to the U.S. (U.S. President 2018; U.S. Trade Representative 2019). This tariff declined 5% each year to reach 15% by 2021. In 2022, the solar tariffs were extended, decreasing 0.25% annually to reach 14% by 2026 (U.S. President 2022). The tariff excluded solar products from Canada and Mexico. Tariffs on Chinese solar cells increased from 25% to 50% in 2024 (The White House 2024).\\nResearch indicates that tariffs increase prices for U.S. consumers, with manufacturers and installers passing the burden of trade tariffs onto consumers (Amiti et al. 2019, Amiti et al. 2020, Houde & Wang 2022). When a $1 tariff is imposed on manufacturers, the final prices of installed photovoltaic (PV) systems increase by $1.35 (Houde & Wang 2022). Similarly, analysis of the 2018 U.S. tariff on washing machines indicate the cost of tariffs is passed to consumers at a rate above 100% (Flaaen et al. 2020).\\nA study of 2018 import tariffs across various goods (steel, aluminum, solar products, and washing machines) found that by December 2018, they had cost U.S. consumers and importing firms $3.2 billion per month in added taxes and $1.4 billion per month in lost economic value (Amiti et al. 2019).\\nTariffs reduce solar industry employment.\\nA study on U.S. solar tariffs found that they reduced overall employment and wages in the U.S. solar industry, as the loss of solar installation jobs outweighed the creation of solar manufacturing jobs (Bollinger et al. 2024). Tariffs increased domestic manufacturing jobs but led to five times the reduction in overall employment. Installation jobs have lower wages than manufacturing jobs, but their economic impact was four times greater than the increase in manufacturing wages, even when considering the difference in pay.\\nA study of duties on solar and wind components between 2011 and 2019 found no evidence of increased manufacturing jobs in these sectors, but jobs in installation, operation, and maintenance grew (Sharma et al. 2022). These were driven by policy incentives and declining technology costs.\\nAs of December 2023, the U.S. solar industry employed 279,447 workers (Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) 2024, Figure 1). Installation and project development accounted for 64% of all solar jobs (178,812 jobs), a 6% growth from 2022 and manufacturing accounted for 12% (33,273 jobs), remaining flat from 2022. While manufacturing jobs depend on domestic panel production, installation jobs rely on both domestic and foreign panel supply (Bollinger et al. 2024).\\nTariffs have slowed down the industry.\\nTariffs provided modest benefits to domestic manufactures (Bollinger et al. 2024, Houde & Wang 2022). After tariffs were imposed in early 2018, domestic solar panel assembly doubled within two years due to manufacturers importing cells tariff-free, but domestic cell production failed to increase (Bollinger et al. 2024).\\nResearch indicates that the absence of tariffs, solar PV demand would have been 17.2% higher (Houde & Wang 2022). From 2012 to 2018, without tariffs, manufactures would have lost $4.6 million in revenue, while installers would have gained $291.8 million (Houde & Wang 2022). Consumers would have saved $369.6 million in solar cost.\\nIn the absence of tariffs, the environmental benefits of avoiding CO2 emissions through the adoption of PV systems would have been $1.2 billion over 25 years (Houde & Wang 2022). This amount was calculated using data on projected reduction in solar power generation due to tariffs, CO2 emissions that would have been avoided with additional solar energy, and the social cost of carbon (SSC). The SSC represents the economic value of reducing one ton of CO2, estimated at $36/ton.\\n\\nFigure 1. U.S. Solar employment growth by sector. Solar employment growth from 2011 to 2023.

and supply gap\\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\\nHIGHLIGHTS\\nTariffs expected to be finalized in June\\nMost new domestic facilities produce modules\\nThe large gap between US solar module manufacturing capacity and the availability of domestic cells, wafers, ingots and polysilicon is prompting concerns that preliminary US tariffs on imported solar cells could disrupt the emerging supply chains they are meant to protect.\\nExpected to be finalized in June, the new tariffs on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam come as the US government again tries to spur a domestic supply chain for the growing industry. The US has already determined that some foreign governments are subsidizing their solar products.\\nMore solar manufacturing facilities are coming online with the support of the Inflation Reduction Act, but so far most new facilities have been for modules because the IRA makes the downstream portion of solar manufacturing the most appealing. It is also easier to stand up production for solar modules than for components further down the supply chain.\\nThe growing domestic module sector has led to a surge of US imports of photovoltaic cells not assembled into panels. Imports expanded to 4,230 MW in the third quarter of 2024, up from 903 MW a year before, with 71% coming from those four countries, according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence Global Trade Analytics Suite. Meanwhile, the US imported 15 GW of panels in the third quarter of 2024, with 80.7% coming from the countries in the trade case.\\n\"Even though we are in a clean energy manufacturing renaissance ... we are still going to need to bring in from some foreign sources, at least cells,\" American Council on Renewable Energy Vice President of Government Affairs Jeremy Horan said in an interview. \"We want to see more domestic production ... but we also have to look at where are we in the supply chain.\"\\nThe importance of a domestic manufacturing industry and tariff support have split the industry between installers and manufacturers for years.\\nInvenergy LLC President and co-founder Jim Murphy is now in the position of being in both markets. Invenergy is a US-based independent power producer with a portfolio composed mostly of renewables but has partnered with Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. Ltd. through a venture called Illuminate USA LLC to manufacture modules in the US at a facility in central Ohio. Murphy also serves as chairman of the board of directors of Illuminate USA.\\nHe said the tariffs would add to the benefits incumbent providers are getting through the IRA by giving them a greater competitive advantage in comparison to upstarts.\\n\"There can be a place for tariffs in trade policy. We get that,\" Murphy said in an interview. \"We just feel like, in particular, this current [antidumping and countervailing duty] case, the motivation is misplaced. On the cell side, where there is no domestic manufacturing, tariffs seem very nonsensical to us.\"\\nBalancing prices, tariffs and domestic incentives\\nAntidumping and countervailing duty petitions filed with the US International Trade Commission and the US Commerce Department will impose new penalties on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells from the four countries, whether or not assembled into modules.\\nThe Commerce Department on Oct. 1, 2024, set initial countervailing duties of 8.25% for Cambodia, 9.13% for Malaysia, 23.06% for Thailand and 2.85% for Vietnam on photovoltaic cell imports. On Nov. 29, 2024, Commerce set preliminary antidumping duties for crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, with general rates at 125.37% for Cambodia, 21.31% for Malaysia, 77.85% for Thailand and 271.28% for Vietnam. Rates can vary by company.\\nMeanwhile, on Jan. 8, the Commerce Department found three new cross-border subsidies from China into Thailand for some Thai manufacturers on wafers, solar glass and silver paste, which raised the CVD rate on products from three companies, according to the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee. Commerce is also investigating cross-border subsidies going into Malaysia, the committee said.\\nThe committee — whose membership includes Convalt Energy LLC, First Solar Inc., Mission Solar Energy LLC, Hanwha Q Cells USA Corp., Meyer Burger Technology AG, REC Silicon ASA and Swift Solar Inc. — filed the petitions with the Commerce Department. If adopted, the tariffs could add 10-15 cents/W for modules, according to a Clean Energy Associates analysis from July 2024.\\n\"Putting duties and tariffs on them are only increasing costs for consumers in the United States,\" ACORE President and CEO Ray Long said.\\nTim Brightbill, a lawyer representing the manufacturing committee seeking the protections, said that with pricing from some imports \"below cost,\" something needs to be done.\\n\"The increased duty rates demonstrate that Thai solar producers are benefiting not only from Thai government subsidies, but also from discounted raw materials received from government-controlled entities in China,\" Brightbill said in a Jan. 9 statement following the finding of the cross-border subsidies.\\n\"You have to have both investment in solar manufacturing, but you also have to have trade enforcement to back up that investment,\" Brightbill said in an interview. \"What we want to see is that unfairly traded products are eliminated from the market, so we\\'re not opposed to trade.\"\\nSolar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition Executive Director Mike Carr said the IRA, domestic content bonuses and tariffs, and other trade actions, are \"a three-legged stool,\" and \"all of those things really have to work together.\"\\n\"This case is important because American manufacturers need a level playing field against China\\'s manufacturers who have gone abroad with subsidies to evade US trade measures,\" Carr said. \"At the same time, the US must create a strong demand driver in the domestic content bonus tax credit for US-made solar components.\"\\nWhile it is cheaper to produce in China because of their subsidies, \"there really isn\\'t a fundamental advantage that they\\'re operating on,\" Carr said.\\nThis is not the first antidumping and countervailing duty petition lobbied against solar imports, but it is the first in the IRA policy environment, which was designed to bolster domestic clean energy manufacturing through incentives.\\n\"The IRA is supposed to allow industry to reestablish itself in North America,\" Davor Sutija, CEO of Germany-headquartered solar wafer manufacturer NexWafe GmbH, said.\\nInvenergy\\'s Murphy said imports are needed because of a lack of sufficient domestic supply for cells, though he would like to see more domestic supply to utilize the domestic content bonus in the IRA.\\n\"We made the decision to get into manufacturing so that we could supplement what we\\'re importing with what we can produce ourselves,\" Murphy said. \"Longer term, we would like to go upstream and have more components of the supply chain coming from our own facilities. But for the near term, for the next several years, it will have to continue to be some mix of import and cell supply.\"\\nWhile domestic manufacturers are trying to get up and running and increase manufacturing capacity, there are concerns that tariffs could hinder this effort.\\n\"It\\'s not helping if it\\'s putting a chill on things and scaring people to take the next step to go further upstream for a fear that actions similar to this one could affect profitability of that further upstream activity,\" Murphy said.\\nThe new tariffs from this trade petition come on top of existing tariffs for the solar industry.\\n\"While the [countervailing duty] tariffs came in lighter than expected, the reverse is true for the just-released [antidumping] tariffs,\" Guggenheim Partners analysts said in a Dec. 2, 2024, note after Commerce released the preliminary antidumping duties.\\nIn a separate trade policy action, the Biden administration on Dec. 12, 2024, imposed higher tariffs on wafers and polysilicon from China and set new tariffs on certain tungsten products from China, potentially adding to US manufacturers\\' costs because such products are not readily available now in the US. The tariff changes took effect Jan. 1.\\nCommerce\\'s final countervailing duty and antidumping rates are to be announced in April, and the International Trade Commission is expected to release its final determinations in early June. Final orders are also expected in June.\\n\\nX LinkedIn Facebook Email WhatsApp\\n\\n\\nTheme\\nEnergy Transition Electric Power Renewables\\n\\nKirsten Errick\\n\\nEditor:\\nDerek Sands\\nRecommended for You\\nMar 27, 2025 #### Japanese Q2 2025 aluminum premium drops 20% QOQ to $182/mt CIF Japan Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the second-quarter premium for imported primary aluminum at $182/mt plus London Metal Exchange\\nMar 28, 2025 #### China releases 12.8 mil mt clean oil products, 5.2 mil mt LSFO export quotas in second batch for 2025 China\\'s Ministry of Commerce issued its second batch of export quotas for clean oil products and low sulfur fuel oil, amounting to 18 million mt,\\nMar 28, 2025 #### INTERVIEW: US hydrogen must be cleaner to compete internationally, says EDF The US slowing down hydrogen infrastructure spending and potentially allowing for\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nOur Purpose\\n\\nOur Values\\nOur History\\nVentures\\nPress Center\\n\\nCareers at S&P Global Commodity Insights\\n\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\nOverview(opens in a new tab)\\nNews Releases(opens in a new tab)\\nQuarterly Earnings(opens in a new tab)\\n\\nSEC Filings & Reports(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nSales & Support(opens in a new tab)\\nSupport by Division\\nReport an Ethics Concern(opens in a new tab)\\nOffice Locations\\n\\nAdvertisers\\n\\n\\nOur Organization\\n\\nCareers\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nLeadership\\nIOSCO ESG Rating & Data Product Statements\\nAbout S&P Global Commodity Insights\\n\\n\\nCookie Settings\\n\\nTerms of Use\\nCookie Notice\\nPrivacy Policy\\nClient Privacy Portal\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information(opens in a new tab)\\n© 2025 S&P Global\\n\\nYour Cookie Controls:\\nS&P Global uses cookies to improve user experience and site performance, offer tailored advertising and enable social media sharing.

Neal Martin\\nThe Impact of U.S. Steel and Aluminum Tariffs: What You Need to Know\\nLast week, the president signed proclamations to ”close existing loopholes and exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on\\xa0steel and elevate the tariff to 25% on\\xa0aluminum.” Significantly impacting the global trade landscape, these measures are the latest in a series of protectionist policies from the Trump administration aimed at boosting domestic production and addressing national security concerns.\\nWhen the tariffs were first introduced by President Trump in 2018, countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom were granted exemptions. According to the White House, these exemptions ultimately weakened the effectiveness of the tariffs. It is the administration’s view that by allowing certain countries to bypass the tariffs, the U.S. unintentionally created loopholes that were exploited by China and other nations with surplus steel and aluminum production, undermining the intent of the exemptions.\\nA White House\\xa0fact sheet provides additional background.\\nWhat’s Happening with the Tariffs?\\nThe reinstated tariffs come with several key provisions and changes aimed at tightening enforcement and ensuring that only U.S.-processed metals benefit from exemptions.\\n\\n\\nReinstatement of Section 232 Tariffs: On February 10, 2025, the president signed proclamations to reinstate a 25% tariff on steel imports and increase the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25%. This decision follows Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. to impose tariffs on goods deemed critical to national security.\\n\\n\\nEffective Date: The tariffs are set to take effect on March 12, 2025. This gives businesses and foreign governments a short window to adjust to the new rules.\\n\\n\\nElimination of Exemptions: Previous agreements that allowed countries to avoid the tariffs are terminated as of March 12, 2025. Furthermore, the reinstated tariffs apply to a broader range of products, with an emphasis on \"melted and poured\" steel and aluminum, ensuring that only domestically processed metals are exempt.\\n\\n\\nAddressing Duty Evasion: Customs and Border Protection will prioritize reviews of imported aluminum and steel, and impose monetary penalties, in the maximum amount allowed by law, for any discovered misclassification of products.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNo Drawbacks: There will be no refunds and reimbursements of duties collected on goods that are later exported or destroyed.\\n\\n\\nProduct Inclusions: The proclamations direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a process by May 11, 2025, allowing U.S. steel and aluminum producers, as well as industry associations, to propose adding more derivative products to the tariffs. Petitioners must demonstrate that the rising imports of these products threaten U.S. national security to qualify.\\n\\n\\nWhy Are These Tariffs Being Imposed?\\nThe primary goal of these tariffs is to shield American industries from unfair competition, including what the administration argues is global overproduction and market distortion due to foreign dumping (selling goods below market price). Additionally, there is a significant national security concern, as steel and aluminum are crucial for defense and infrastructure projects.\\nThese tariffs are also a key component of a wider strategy to boost U.S. manufacturing and foster domestic economic growth. By increasing the cost of imported metals, the U.S. government aims to encourage local production and lessen reliance on foreign suppliers.\\nImplications for the U.S. Economy\\nThe reinstatement of steel and aluminum tariffs will have far-reaching implications for the U.S. economy, affecting everything from domestic manufacturing to consumer prices and global trade relations.\\n\\n\\nDomestic Steel and Aluminum Producers: The tariffs are designed to protect U.S. manufacturers from foreign competition. In theory, domestic companies will be able to increase their production and expand their workforce, which could have positive effects on the economy in the long term.\\n\\n\\nHigher Costs for Consumers: While the tariffs benefit U.S. producers, they are expected to increase the cost of steel and aluminum-based products, including cars, appliances, and homes. This could lead to higher prices for consumers and disrupt industries that rely heavily on these materials, such as automotive manufacturers and construction companies.\\n\\n\\nSupply Chain Disruptions: Automakers, for example, have already voiced concerns that the higher costs of steel and aluminum could slow production and increase car prices. Supply chain disruptions may also occur, particularly for industries that rely on just-in-time production systems.\\n\\n\\nGlobal Reactions and Consequences\\nThe U.S. decision to reinstate steel and aluminum tariffs has sparked strong reactions from global trade partners, with some countries voicing their opposition and preparing retaliatory measures.\\n\\n\\nCanada and Mexico: These two countries, which were previously exempt from the tariffs, are now subject to them, a move that has raised tensions with the U.S. Both countries have criticized the decision, calling the tariffs unjustified. Canada, the largest exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States, has already threatened retaliatory tariffs, which could escalate trade tensions between the two countries.\\n\\n\\nEuropean Union: European leaders have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the new tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, indicated that the EU would retaliate firmly against the U.S. action. Retaliatory tariffs from Europe could target a range of American products, further straining international trade relations.\\n\\n\\nOther Trade Partners: Many other countries, including major suppliers like Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, are expected to feel the impact of the tariffs. Some may seek to challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO), claiming that they violate global trade rules.\\n\\n\\nThe Road Ahead\\nThese tariffs are part of a larger economic strategy that focuses on reducing reliance on imports while simultaneously protecting key industries in the U.S. However, they come with significant risks—rising costs for consumers, trade retaliation, and potential strain on global supply chains.\\nWhile the full long-term effects of these tariffs remain to be seen, one thing is certain: the international trading landscape will continue to evolve, with nations carefully navigating their relationships with the U.S. As we move forward, it will be essential to watch how these tariffs affect everything from the price of goods to the stability of global trade networks.\\nSubscribe\\nSign up to receive email updates from ML Strategies/Mintz.\\nSubscribe Now\\nPublished\\n\\nFebruary 20, 2025\\n\\nViewpoint Topics\\n\\nTrade & International Affairs\\n\\nProfessionals\\n\\nR.

We appreciate President Trump’s focus and attention on growing and strengthening the U.S. aluminum industry, and there is a lot to like in today’s action. The domestic industry has invested more than $10 billion since 2016 mostly in mid-and-downstream production and recycling. This has been driven by growing demand, a competitive tax environment and strong, targeted trade enforcement the president supported in his first term. For this growth to continue, the U.S. aluminum industry needs two things – long-term market certainty and a reliable supply of affordable metal, which today comes in large part from Canada.”\\nAs articulated in a recent LinkedIn article, America needs aluminum. Aluminum is a critical material for our economy and national defense – used in everything from cars to beverage cans to fighter jets. Today, the United States is investing significantly and will need both smelted and recycled aluminum to meet growing demand. In the years if not decades it will take to build new U.S. smelter capacity, our metal needs must be met by importing.\\nAt the same time, the industry’s decades-long trading relationship with Canada is a good deal for America. The aluminum we import from Canada today is equivalent to the energy generated by at least 4 Hoover Dams. And just one Canadian smelter job supports about 13 U.S. aluminum jobs further downstream.\\n“President Trump’s administration is aggressively pursuing multiple tariff initiatives on behalf of the broader U.S. economy. The U.S. aluminum industry needs certainty in this tariff landscape to support our growth and investment,” added Johnson. “Today’s action closes loopholes in existing Section 232 tariffs that will support our industry’s expansion. However, we encourage President Trump and his administration to deliver a deal with Canada to ensure robust metal supply for U.S. manufacturers and consumers as he did in his first term with the USMCA.”\\nTrade\\n# # #\\nAbout The Aluminum Association\\nThe Aluminum Association represents the full value chain of aluminum production and jobs in the United States, including companies that make 70% of the aluminum and aluminum products shipped in North America.

Manage Subscriptions\\nSubscribe  \\nRight now, the US is preparing to expand a 25% tariff to a wider range of imported steel and aluminum products while also eliminating exemptions for all countries and importers, without exception.\\nThe Trump administration announced the impending tariffs on February 10 on the grounds of national security. They would newly apply to key trading partners, such as the EU and Canada, that so far have been excluded from duties or subject to quotas since the tariffs were first imposed in 2018. US manufacturers and other importers will no longer have recourse to individual exclusions.\\nThe new tariffs go into effect on March 12. They will apply to a range of products, including steel, aluminum, and certain “derivatives” containing the metals that will be taxed based on their steel and aluminum content.\\nThe So What\\nThe new tariffs would have a far-reaching impact on manufacturing costs and supply chains across a range of industries in the US and exporting nations. Current US tariffs will extend to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, which together account for around three-quarters of US steel imports by volume.\\n“Steel and aluminum producers and customers must move swiftly to understand what these tariffs will mean to them and how they can mitigate any negative impact,” says Nicole Voigt, a BCG managing director and partner who co-leads the firm’s work in metals.\\nIf implemented as announced, BCG projects that, once everything is priced in, the new steel and aluminum tariffs would:\\n\\nAdd $22.4 billion to the cost of steel and aluminum products the US imports and up to an additional $29 billion for derivative products.\\nIncrease the affected amount of imported steel from 7 million metric tons to 26 million. With the expansion to “derivative” products, such as elevator parts, bulldozer blades, lamps, and structural steel, the value of goods being tariffed could more than double to $72 billion.\\nIncrease the affected amount of imported aluminum from 2.3 million metric tons to 3.5 million. When derivative products like baseball bats and some aircraft and kitchen appliance parts are included, the value of goods being tariffed would reach $132 billion.\\nMost heavily affect the US metals manufacturing industry, the biggest user of imported steel and aluminum (24% and 35% import dependence respectively). The automotive, mechanical machinery, construction industries, and various consumer sectors will also be significantly impacted.\\nBoost prices and profit margins for US steel and aluminum manufacturers.\\n\\n“Many companies are already starting to update their pricing and optimize their inventory and supply chains, ” says Janice Lee, who co-leads BCG’s global work in metals. “Others are discussing potential capacity expansion.”\\nThese estimates don’t account for retaliatory actions taken by US trading partners and counter measures the US may take in response. The EU and Canada have indicated they will retaliate against US exports but have not yet released details.\\nFurther trade actions may come. For instance, the February 10 executive order provides a mechanism for US steel and aluminum producers and industry associations to seek extending the tariffs to even more derivative goods containing steel or aluminum.\\nUnlike the tariffs imposed in President Trump’s first term, moreover, US steel and aluminum customers will have limited ways to avoid paying the duties. The US has granted more than 100,000 individual exclusions since 2018 to importers that demonstrate limited domestic availability of specific steel and aluminum products. That system for granting or renewing exclusions is now shut.\\nThe Trump administration is taking a different approach to steel and aluminum tariffs than it did in 2018.\\n“This time, there is less dealmaking with countries and no room for companies to get exceptions,” says Iacob Koch-Weser, a BCG associate director who specializes in trade and investment.\\n“The main options are to source domestically or pay more for imported materials. Shifting sourcing locations is less useful if everyone faces the same tariffs.”\\nSubscribe to receive BCG insights on the most pressing issues facing international business.\\nSubscribe\\nManage Subscriptions \\nNow What\\nThe key issues and options facing business leaders largely depend on their place in the value chain.\\nUS steel and aluminum companies in the short term will need to manage change in demand through pricing and adjusting production and inventory. Over the longer term, they should determine whether to invest in more capacity, explore making higher value-added products that have primarily been imported thus far, and improve operational efficiency to remain competitive.\\nUS steel and aluminum customers must immediately calculate the tariffs’ impact on their material costs and their prices. They should identify ways to mitigate impact, such as by documenting their products’ metals content to qualify for lower tariffs, renegotiating with current metals suppliers, shifting to other suppliers, or using alternative materials.\\nExporters of steel and aluminum products to the US should determine whether they can remain cost-competitive in this market, and in which segments. Without the exemptions that existed previously, exporters will need to reassess the competitive landscape. They can also consider diversifying exports to other regions to offset revenue lost in the US.\\nRelated Content\\n\\nInternational Trade\\nArticle\\nJanuary 13, 2025\\nGreat Powers, Geopolitics, and the Future of Trade\\nNew BCG research forecasts dramatic changes in world trade flows in the coming decade as national alliances, rivalries, and aspirations rewire the global economy.\\nLearn More\\n\\nInternational Trade\\nArticle\\nFebruary 13, 2025\\nHow to Prepare for Tariffs and the New Reality of Global Trade\\nIf implemented, new tariffs would affect 44% of all US imports.

At a February 2025 press conference in Mar-a-Lago, Trump hinted that the US will impose a 25%+ tariff on pharmaceuticals in the future, after giving time to US companies to build more manufacturing capacity.\\nOn 4 March 2025, Trump imposed tariffs on most imports from Canada, Mexico and China, set at 25% for Canada and Mexico, and doubled on China from 10% to 20%. These could come into effect as early as 2 April. Canada has responded with its own 25% tariffs on a range of US goods. Meanwhile, the US and the EU are trading threats of tariffs on metals and alcohol.\\nOn 26 February, Eli Lilly announced plans to construct four manufacturing sites in the US at a cost of at least $27 billion. Three of the sites will focus on manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), effectively reshoring the company’s small molecule API production. The fourth location will extend Lilly’s injectables production. Other contributing factors for the investment include high global demand for Lilly’s weight loss and diabetes drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide).\\nCanada has responded with 25% tariffs on a range of US goods\\nPfizer is also considering moving overseas manufacturing to its existing plants in the US. Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, stated at the TD Cowen Healthcare Conference on 3 March that if tariffs came into play, “we will try to mitigate by transferring from manufacturing sites outside to manufacturing sites here [in the US].” Bourla described the tariff situation as “volatile…[…] We don’t know what will happen […] We don’t know if the tariffs will be in Canada and Mexico, in China. And clearly, we don’t know what will happen in Europe. But they have other bigger problems now to deal with.”\\nOn 11 March 2025, Merck & Co. opened a $1 billion manufacturing facility in North Carolina to boost production of its blockbuster HPV vaccine, Gardasil. Merck described this as “a crucial component of the more than $12 billion Merck has invested toward US capital investment since 2018, focused on expanding domestic manufacturing and research and development capabilities and creating new jobs in the US, with another $8 billion of US capital investment expected by 2028.”\\nPressure may continue to increase on pharma companies to repatriate production to the US, resulting in higher production costs and potentially an inflationary effect on medicine prices too. Alternatively, if pharma companies are prevented from raising prices, this could result in company profit losses. Many Americans are already facing higher consumer price inflation and rising unemployment, driven by the dual effects of widespread layoffs by the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and trade tariffs, which could result in declining domestic demand for pharma products.\\nRetaliatory tariffs could lead to a decline in exports\\nDrug price regulation may also become more pronounced in markets. In the US, price negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act could become much more entrenched.\\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by target countries will make US products less attractive and could lead to a decline in exports and a potential shrinkage of the US workforce of the most affected companies.\\nMany manufacturers of generics are based in China and India\\u200b; generic and biosimilar prescriptions account for 90% of prescriptions filled in the US. Drug shortages were particularly pronounced in 2024, and tariffs could exacerbate those problems in 2025. There would be significant disruption to the global supply chain.\\nIt is difficult to predict how long-standing any trade tariffs will be, and whether deals can be made to lessen potential disruptions. However, this could be significantly disruptive for companies hoping to supply the world’s largest pharma market, and costly for global consumers.\\nFree Buyers Guide\\nLeading Guide to Pharmaceutical Solid Dose (Commercial Dose) Manufacturing Companies for the Pharmaceutical Industry\\nThe document includes detailed information on the manufacturers and suppliers and their products, along with contact details, to inform your purchasing decision.\\nThank you.\\nYour download email will arrive shortly.

These policies aim to correct trade imbalances and bolster domestic manufacturing, but they also present significant challenges for global pharmaceutical supply chains. This article examines the latest developments, industry reactions, and potential consequences for consumers.\\nLatest Developments in Tariff Policies\\nAs of March 2025, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has introduced a series of tariffs, with a specific focus on China. Key measures include:\\n\\nA 10% tariff on Chinese goods, with considerations of increasing this to 25% on pharmaceutical imports.\\nTemporary suspension of proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico following preliminary trade agreements.\\n\\nThese tariffs, if implemented on pharmaceuticals, could mark a significant shift from the industry’s long-standing tariff exemptions.\\nIndustry Leaders’ Responses\\nPharmaceutical giants are closely monitoring these policy shifts and assessing their potential impact:\\n\\nNovartis: Chairman Joerg Reinhardt stated that while the company is evaluating potential tariff impacts, they are not in panic mode. Historically, pharmaceuticals have been exempt from tariffs, and Reinhardt believes any financial repercussions would be limited at this stage.\\nPfizer: CEO Albert Bourla highlighted that Pfizer could mitigate tariff-related disruptions by leveraging its existing ten U.S. manufacturing sites and two distribution centers, reducing reliance on imports.\\n\\nChallenges for the Pharmaceutical Sector\\nThe imposition of tariffs presents several obstacles for pharmaceutical companies:\\n\\nIncreased Production Costs: Import tariffs on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and finished products from China could raise manufacturing expenses. Generic drug manufacturers, already operating on thin margins, would be particularly affected.\\nSupply Chain Disruptions: Pharmaceutical supply chains rely on global partnerships. Tariffs could lead to bottlenecks, delays, and potential shortages of essential medicines.\\nR&D Constraints: Higher operational costs could divert funds away from research and development, slowing innovation in drug discovery and new treatments.\\n\\nConsequences for Consumers\\nThe effects of tariffs will likely extend beyond pharmaceutical firms, impacting patients and the broader public:\\n\\nHigher Drug Prices: Companies may pass on increased costs to consumers, leading to price hikes for both generic and branded medications.\\nLimited Access to Medications: Supply chain disruptions could lead to shortages, potentially affecting the availability of critical drugs.\\nEconomic Strain: Rising healthcare costs could place additional financial burdens on patients, particularly those without robust insurance coverage, leading to reduced adherence to prescribed treatments.\\n\\nStrategic Responses and Future Outlook\\nTo counter these challenges, pharmaceutical companies are adopting various strategies:\\n\\nExpanding Domestic Manufacturing: Companies like Pfizer are increasing production within the U.S. to reduce dependence on imported APIs and mitigate tariff-related risks.\\nIndustry Advocacy: Pharmaceutical associations are engaging policymakers to seek tariff exemptions for essential drugs, emphasizing public health concerns.\\nSupply Chain Diversification: Firms may explore alternative sourcing strategies, shifting away from China and strengthening partnerships with suppliers in other regions.\\n\\nThe ongoing trade disputes pose significant challenges to the pharmaceutical industry, with potential consequences for drug pricing, availability, and innovation. A continuous dialogue between industry stakeholders and policymakers will be crucial in navigating these complexities and ensuring that public health remains a priority.\\nPharmaceutical\\nPharmaceutical\\nComments are closed.\\nLatest Blogs & News\\nTop 10 Blockbuster Drugs Losing U.S. Exclusivity in 2025\\nMarch 25, 2025\\nPharma Dealmaking & IPO Surge: Key Trends in 2025\\nMarch 20, 2025\\nEU CTR 2025: What It Means for Clinical Trials & Supply Chain\\nMarch 13, 2025\\nHow US Tariffs Are Reshaping the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain\\nMarch 6, 2025\\nThe API Supply Chain Playbook: How to Source the Right Suppliers Efficiently\\nFebruary 28, 2025\\nTop Breakthrough Medications to Watch in 2025\\nFebruary 24, 2025\\nHow the Trump Administration’s Drug Pricing Policies Will Reshape Pharma\\nFebruary 13, 2025\\nThe Shift in Pharma M&A: Moving Towards Targeted, High-Impact Deals\\nFebruary 5, 2025\\nKey Investments & Mergers Reshaping CDMO/CMO Landscape in 2024\\nJanuary 10, 2025\\n7 Overlooked Challenges in API Manufacturing and Effective Solutions\\nJanuary 4, 2025\\n\\nFollow Us\\n    \\nQuick Links\\n\\nSource Globally\\nSell Globally\\nConcierge Pricing\\nConnect Globally\\nCreate Linkage Globally\\nEnlist Globally\\nFind Global Buyers\\n\\nOther Links\\n\\nWho We Are\\nBusiness Lounge\\nResources\\nContact Us\\nFAQs\\nReady Reckoner\\n\\nSubscribe to our newsletter\\n\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDisclaimer\\n\\nFortuna Theme © 2023 \\xa0 | \\xa0 BlueOwlCreative', 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 9.17}\n"

Please let us know if you have feedback.\\nThe Trump administration intensified tariff pressure this week, moving to impose 25% levies on Canada and Mexico, and then largely reversing course, and raising the existing Chinese tariffs to 20% across the board. The wide-ranging tariffs are an economic cudgel to achieve political ends, potentially spurring companies to bring manufacturing back to U.S. soil.\\nBut will it work?\\nSome companies, including Pfizer, have already signaled a willingness to move in that direction. Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $50 billion into refurbishing and building facilities in the U.S. to ramp up domestic manufacturing capabilities following a meeting with President Donald Trump.\\nHowever, for generic drug makers, which are hardest hit by Chinese tariffs, slim profit margins and high costs may thwart reshoring efforts, even if they are willing to bring their business elsewhere, said Michael Abrams, managing partner of Numerof & Associates.\\n\\n“Everybody would agree that not being reliant on foreign sources — and China in particular — is a good idea.”\\n\\nMichael Abrams\\nManaging partner, Numerof & Associates\\n\\n“Manufacturers that are opting out of manufacturing certain products because the margins are too thin probably don’t have the capital to go and build their own manufacturing facilities here in the U.S.,” he said.\\nCompanies that make branded drugs could simply absorb the price increases from tariffs rather than take on the high cost of a move because the relocation process takes long enough for the political winds to shift, Abrams said.\\nIn addition, it’s still not clear how the tariffs will play out. Some promised tariffs haven’t materialized yet, and the administration has delayed or scaled back implementation on some while granting exemptions for others, creating broad uncertainty.\\nBringing manufacturing home\\nThe push to bring drug manufacturing back to the U.S. isn’t new or particularly controversial.\\n“Everybody would agree that not being reliant on foreign sources — and China in particular — is a good idea,” Abrams said, noting that the pandemic dramatically illustrated the risks of foreign dependence.\\n“When we were experiencing drug shortages is when we became aware that 72% of APIs in our market were coming from overseas,” Abrams said. “It was a bit of a shock to realize how dependent we were, and there was a real push to do something about it.”\\nKeep up with the story.

The Biden Administration also put money toward reshoring efforts. Even so, there’s been limited progress.\\nCompanies interested in returning to the U.S. could take advantage of existing manufacturing sites that stood idle for years, Abrams said. One survey of 40 generic drug manufacturing sites found that underutilized facilities could produce 30 billion doses of medicines. However, barriers still exist.\\n“It really comes down to the money,” Abrams said, specifically labor costs. “Labor has been more expensive in the U.S. and all the associated regulation that goes with it, and I think that’s the predominant issue.”\\nThe calculus could change if companies gain incentives to move, such as loans or other options to mitigate the risks of acquiring U.S. facilities, Abrams said.\\nCompanies shouldn’t react too impulsively to the tariffs, said Arda Ural, EY Americas industry markets leader for health sciences and wellness. Investing in U.S. manufacturing sites requires significant capital, and companies should weigh the cost against other priorities, such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or technological investments, he said.\\nIn addition, tariffs could ultimately make borrowing money to invest in manufacturing more expensive if they drive up inflation and delay interest rate cuts.\\n“Pharma companies, whether they are generics or branded pharmaceuticals, need to wait for the dust to settle before making those massive capital allocations,” Ural said.\\nRead More in Manufacturing\\nMar 21, 2025How pharma could feel the pain of a recession\\nMar 19, 2025The key factors shaping China’s biopharma boom\\nFeb 19, 2025Merck, Lilly launch manufacturing R&D consortium to help ‘bolster’ U.S. production\\nFeb 07, 2025Tariffs raise concern among generic drugmakers, and advocacy groups are seeking exemptions\\nDec 20, 202410 of our most read articles of 2024\\nDec 18, 2024Big Pharma’s new DTC play: partnering with digital health providers\\nDec 06, 2024Trump’s tariffs could put more pressure on the U.S. to produce generic drugs.

Steel tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration succeeded in raising domestic prices but didn’t deliver more manufacturing jobs. The latest round may face similar challenges in achieving the intended goal.\\n“I would say the odds are good that whatever this administration does to encourage reshoring is something that most manufacturers will simply grit their teeth and bear the pain,” Abrams said — because in four years tariffs may no longer be a priority.\\nRecommended Reading\\n\\nTariffs raise concern among generic drugmakers, and advocacy groups are seeking exemptions Kelly Bilodeau\\nTrump’s tariffs could put more pressure on the U.S. to produce generic drugs.

We’re proud to say we never gave up on Made in USA. These tariffs highlight why keeping jobs in America matters—our customers and partners can trust us to deliver quality footwear without the uncertainties of overseas manufacturing. “Tariffs are a fluid situation that we are constantly monitoring,” said, Burns.\\nWhy Thorogood Benefits from the Tariffs:\\n\\nCompetitive Pricing:\\xa0As tariffs increase the cost of imported footwear, Thorogood’s American-made boots offer a more affordable and stable alternative without added duties.\\nReliable Supply Chain:\\xa0Unlike competitors facing delays, factory shifts, and material shortages, Thorogood maintains consistent production in the U.S.\\nConsumer Confidence:\\xa0Customers who want high-quality, American-made footwear can count on Thorogood, free from tariff-related price spikes.\\n\\nWith inflation and pricing concerns top-of-mind for American consumers, Thorogood Footwear emerges as the smart choice for work boots that are built to last—without the risk of overseas disruptions. Thorogood’s commitment to American manufacturing is further backed up by their recent Wisconsin’s Manufacturer of the Year Award, won last month.\\nAbout Thorogood Footwear:\\nThorogood Footwear, a division of Weinbrenner Shoe Company, has been crafting American-made, high-quality work boots for over 130 years. As an employee-ownedcompany, Thorogood remains committed to supporting American workers, providing durable footwear, and delivering industry-leading craftsmanship.\\nFor more information, visit\\xa0www.thorogoodusa.com.\\nPress Contact:\\nAnna Kapla\\nMarketing Operations Coordinator\\nakapla@weinbrennerusa.com\\n651-272-7821\\nEmail: info@fdra.org\\nPhone: 202-737-5660\\nView Privacy Policy\\nDC Office Location:\\n200 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Suite 700\\nWashington, DC 20001\\nNY Office Location:\\n450 Lexington Ave, 4th floor\\nNew York, NY 10017\\n\\n  Notifications\\n', 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 0.91}\n"

They don’t want to pull production out of Mexico, they said, nor do they want to raise prices. Tariffs aside, “it’s already hard to compete with these large multibillion-dollar companies,” they said.\\nKacy is one of millions of retail leaders trying to find a way forward as U.S. President Donald Trump slaps import tariffs on a wide range of goods. Countries are issuing retaliatory duties in response, and Trump is vowing to enact even more tariffs on April 2. Trump also imposed tariffs during his first term in office, the effects of which are still being felt today.\\nAll of this is a perfect storm for any industry, but particularly for footwear, which is especially susceptible to tariffs. Some 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. today is imported, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade and business association representing more than 500 companies across the U.S. According to the FDRA, the U.S. imports 2.4 billion pairs of shoes a year — enough for seven pairs per person.\\nFootwear, like apparel, largely relies on other countries for manufacturing. Producing footwear requires significant capital, heavy machinery and a sizable workforce — not to mention established supplier relationships, product safety standards and chemical safety oversight. Only a handful of sourcing countries, many of which are in Asia, have the existing infrastructure to accommodate demand. These include China, Vietnam, India and Indonesia. For its fiscal 2024 year, Nike manufactured 50% of its Nike brand footwear in Vietnam, 27% in Indonesia and 18% in China.\\nBuilding this capacity in the U.S. — and thereby avoiding tariffs — would be a tall task. There are dozens of components that go into footwear, and for the U.S. to make an entire shoe at home, it would need to supply everything from cotton for laces to plastic for eyelets to rubber for soles. Developing this supplier base “would take decades,” the FDRA wrote in a March 11 letter to the U.S. government. The country would also have to “hire and train thousands of workers in the intricacies of shoemaking,” the FDRA said, noting that some of its members have already found there to be “a lack of interest [from] workers wanting to work in a shoe factory.”\\nBecause so much U.S. footwear is imported, tariffs are already high. The FDRA estimates that footwear is taxed at an average of 12.3%, compared to less than 2% for other consumer goods. Trump-era tariffs are only exacerbating this, Matt Priest, the CEO and president of the FDRA, told Modern Retail. “We’ve had tariffs in place since 1930, so this is just adding insult to injury,” Priest explained. Meanwhile, Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader at PwC, told Modern Retail that overall import costs for footwear could increase to 40-50% because of new tariffs.\\nKane, a footwear brand that makes recovery shoes, manufactures in Brazil. The company is “praying” that the U.S. won’t enact additional tariffs, its founder and CEO John Gagliardi told Modern Retail. “We can’t control that, but that’s something we talk about,” he said. As a contingency measure, Kane is preemptively increasing the inventory it has on hand in the U.S. “We’re just trying to get more product in before something happens,” Gagliardi said. “But we’re not changing our production.”\\nPWC estimates that Trump’s new tariffs — as well as any reciprocal ones — will cost the footwear industry $5.9 billion a year. Some footwear brands and retailers plan to pass this on to consumers via price increases; ninety-seven percent of respondents to a recent FDRA survey said they would do so. That level is “unheard of,” Priest said. “We’ve done this survey for four years, and it’s the worst outlook we’ve ever published.”\\nThis is worrying because footwear prices are already high, said Beth Goldstein, a footwear analyst with Circana. In fact, footwear prices are up 30% since 2019, she told Modern Retail. Much of that is because of supply chain delays and material shortages due to the pandemic. But, Goldstein said, this is likely to be the new normal.\\n“Footwear is not an industry like food or gas where, when costs go back down, [companies] are going to lower the price,” she said. “The MSRP [manufacturer’s suggested retail price] is now at a high level, … and consumers are already feeling the pain.” If prices increase even more, “we would probably see unit demand start to slide again,” Goldstein said.\\nPriest agreed. “When the import price goes up, the retail price goes up,” he said. “And when you drive up prices, you drive down sales. There’s lots of concern out there in the marketplace, for sure.”\\nBack in November, the National Retail Federation estimated that U.S. consumers could lose $46 billion to $78 billion in spending power each year that the tariffs are in place. For footwear, specifically, customers can expect to pay $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more a year, according to the NRF.\\nWhile Trump may be counting on tariffs to boost products “made in America,” that’s easier said than done for footwear, sources say.\\n“You would think by the political rhetoric [that] the administration really wants to encourage domestic production with the tariffs,” Priest said. However, he noted, the typical sneaker already has an estimated 20% tariff on it, including a 7.5% tariff added during Trump’s last term.\\n“They have rhetoric, but the policy doesn’t line up with that rhetoric,” Priest said.\\n\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nReddit\\n\\nMore in Operations\\nNew Economic Realities\\nModern Retail Rundown: Dollar Tree sells Family Dollar, GameStop bets on Bitcoin & H&M’s profit plummets\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nOn this week\\'s Modern Retail Rundown, the staff discusses Dollar Tree\\'s decision to offload its struggling Family Dollar segment for $1 billion.

And a new study from the National Retail Federation (NRF) has found that if implemented, his tariffs could cost US consumers between $46 billion and $78 billion each year.\\nThe recent study from the retail trade group examined how Trump’s tariffs proposals could impact the following categories: apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods. Trump’s proposed tariff plans include a 10 to 20 percent tariff on imports from all foreign countries and an additional 60 to 100 percent tariff on imports specifically from China. Within footwear in particular, the study found that U.S. consumers could pay between $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more for footwear a year.\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nAs Trump Plans to Double Tariffs on China, Twisted X Pledges to Not Raise Its Prices\\n\\nFDRA’s Matt Priest Says Trump’s Additional 10% Tariff on China Would Be ‘Catastrophic’ for Some Shoe Companies\\nFor example, the study revealed that a $50 pair of sneakers could rise to between $59 and $64 dollars.\\nWatch on FN\\nOn the other hand, Kamala Harris’ tariff policies\\xa0were expected to be a continuation of President Joe Biden’s policies, which included keeping the burdensome Section 301 rates in place, which have also contributed to higher shoe prices at retail.\\n“Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,” NRF’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy Jonathan Gold said in a statement. “A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers’ pockets through higher prices.”\\n99 percent of the shoes sold in the United States are currently imported from primarily China, Vietnam and Indonesia. With the U.S. footwear industry bringing in 2.5 billion shoes a year, it already pays $4 billion a year in tariffs.\\nShoe prices were mostly flat in September from a year ago, but the category is expected to see an overall rise by the end of 2024 for the fourth straight year, according to the latest data from the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA).\\nShoe industry trade groups have been vocal about the adverse effects that tariffs bring to consumers. In September, a survey from FDRA found that tariffs and trade policy were top of mind for U.S. shoe executives in the third quarter.\\n“Our Q3 Shoe Executive Survey reflects both the optimism and the challenges facing the footwear industry,” said FDRA president and chief executive officer Matt Priest in a statement in September. “With trade policy looming large in a presidential election year and consumer behavior constantly evolving, our members are prepared to navigate these uncertainties. FDRA will continue to provide the tools and insights they need to succeed.”\\nRead More:\\n\\n\\nElection Day\\n\\n\\nFDRA\\n\\n\\nTariff\\n\\n\\nDaily Headlines\\nSubscribe\\nYou May Like\\n Email Validation Tools & Email List Cleaning | ZeroBounce www.zerobounce.net | Sponsored  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\\n How Long Does $1 Million Last After 60?

They say more effort could be needed, whether it’s relaxed regulation, tariffs to go higher or a greater effort to build up an American manufacturing workforce.\\nOr all of the above.\\nIn addition to those furniture executives interviewed earlier this month, two more – Kevin Kauffman, CEO of Simply Amish; and Marcus Bontrager, president of Fusion Designs – shared their perspectives with Furniture Today.\\n\\nKevin Kauffman\\n“I don’t think tariffs will create a lot of manufacturing jobs, at least without a lot of other help,” said Kauffman. “It’s still difficult to find people who have talent and want to work, so we can only create so many jobs of that nature.\\n“Of course, adding technology will help with the overall increase in manufacturing, which is where we are going. We can use technology to help us create custom furniture, but we will most likely never be a source for product that competes with Asia prices.”\\nBontrager at Fusion Designs was more hopeful but still on the doubtful side.\\n“I believe there will only be a short-term benefit to tariffs unless they go higher,” he said. “Right now, a lot of suppliers are avoiding the tariffs by moving out of China, but that doesn’t mean they’re returning to the U.S.\\n\\n“If people knew tariffs would be long term (longer than four years), I think you would see much more investment in American manufacturing. I think a lot of importers at this point are trying to ride it out and looking for temporary solutions.”\\n\\nBontrager said he believes automation will be the only way to compete with low labor costs overseas.\\n“Right now, it seems automation is the only way to compete,” he said. “However, if elevated tariffs remain, I think we could incentivize labor and craftsmanship again, but it would not be cheap, so I am not sure that we could ever compete with Asia on that end. One of the best things we can offer a retailer is that they don’t have to inventory as much. We can build on demand and ship as needed.”\\nLike others, Bontrager said lower-end case goods will be toughest to bring back.\\xa0“It is such a massive investment that I believe most importers look at the risk of making such an investment vs. simply importing and cannot justify the return.”\\nSee also:\\n\\nDo tariffs have the potential to bring furniture manufacturing back to the U.S.?\\nSteel tariffs: Here’s how furniture will be affected\\n\\ns\\nShare this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\nContributor Content ### Importers find reliability, capacity at SC Ports Retailers are experiencing unprecedented consumer demand for[...] April 15, 2021\\nContributor Content ### What the Newest Round of Tariffs Means for Consumer Goods Brands The White House announced that it would impose a 10% tariff [...] July 31, 2018\\n ### Tariff talk hijacks High Point Premarket | Bill McLoughlin Conversations at last week’s Premarket instead were domina[...] March 29, 2025\\n ### Two domestic furniture execs answer: Are tariffs enough to bring jobs back?

An additional 40% anticipated a \"somewhat significant\" effect, while only 2% claimed there would be no impact.\\n\\nPhoto: Dreamstime.\\nThe most anticipated consequence of these tariffs would be increased prices for consumers (87%) and within the supply chain (83%). Respondents also noted other potential challenges, including inflation (71%), production shifts to other countries (68%), retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports (56%), product shortages (44%), and job losses in targeted countries (43%).\\nNearly half (45%) of the respondents predicted that U.S. furniture sales would decrease in the upcoming year due to the tariffs. Conversely, 13% thought there would be a temporary boost in sales as consumers sought to avoid higher prices or shortages. A positive outcome for domestic manufacturers, mentioned by 41%, could be a surge in demand for American-made products.\\nTo mitigate the impacts, furniture companies indicated various strategies, such as increasing prices, adjusting international sourcing, boosting domestic production, stockpiling inventory before tariffs take effect, lay-offs, developing long-term strategies, and adopting a wait-and-see approach. Potential alternative sourcing countries mentioned included Vietnam, India, Brazil, and European nations that have low or no tariffs.\\nConfidence in the tariffs being implemented as planned was mixed among respondents. While two-thirds expressed confidence, nearly 17% thought there might be changes before the new administration took office in January, and 18% were unsure. Most respondents (40%) believed the effects would be immediate, with others predicting impacts within weeks (30%) or months (19%).\\nThe survey also highlighted the reliance on China, Canada, and Mexico within the industry. One-third of respondents noted that over half of their business involved one or more of these countries. Specifically, 57% sourced furniture from China, 34% from Mexico, and 18% from Canada. China was identified as the top sourcing country for 38% of respondents, followed by Mexico (33%) and Canada (27%).\\nThe survey concluded that the upholstery segment would be the most affected, followed by case goods, furniture components, textiles, and mattresses.  \\nSource: www.furnituretoday.com\\nPublication date: Tue 10 Dec 2024  \\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\nPost\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\nMail\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n ### Freight rates hit lowest level since January 2024\\n ### Concerns over Chinese influence at ports\\n ### Trump tariffs highlight US reliance on foreign imports\\n ### Drewry World Container Index continues downward trend as market stabilises\\n\\n ### Shipping company Maersk under fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n ### Euro area trade surplus shrinks to €1.0 billion in January 2025\\n ### OECD economic outlook warns of slower growth amid rising policy uncertainty\\n ### Strongest Dutch export growth in 2.5 years\\n ### Drewry\\'s World Container Index declines as freight rates fall\\n ### Portuguese furniture exports surpass two billion euros despite decline\\n\\nLatest photo reports → See More\\n\\n ### Meble Polska\\n ### January Furniture Show 2025\\n ### Maison&Objet January 2025\\n\\n ### Brussels Furniture Fair\\n\\n\\nFreshpublishers InteriorDaily.com\\n\\nOur Team\\nWork at InteriorDaily.com\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\nPartner Sites\\n\\n\\nWonen360.nl\\n\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAdvertise\\nEmail\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nTerms of Delivery\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nFreshPublishers © 2005-2025 InteriorDaily.com\\n', 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 1.04}\n"

He also seems to be using them as negotiation leverage against Canada and Mexico.\\nBut what do furniture manufacturers think?\\nShannon Williams, CEO of the Home Furnishings Assn., believes that even with tariffs, bringing manufacturing back is going to be a tough task. Particularly with raw materials and labor, she believes manufacturers must find ways to innovate.\\n\\nShannon Williams\\n“Regardless of tariffs, the U.S. labor market cannot support full scale manufacturing. First, most U.S. furniture companies are assembling, not manufacturing,” she said. “About 50% of the components and materials used in production are sourced globally. The U.S. is not manufacturing the wood, metals, textiles, glass, hinges, screws needed for production.\\n“Second, the U.S. unemployment rate is 4%. If 30% of those unemployed could work in manufacturing, we are talking about 2 million jobs across the whole U.S. … for every industry. Asia has hundreds of millions of manufacturing jobs.\\n“Third, the average manufacturing worker overseas is making $13,000 per year,” she continued. “In the U.S., labor costs are 3.36 times that at $43,000. Increased costs will increase prices and affect demand. There are certainly manufacturers that may choose to lean into craftmanship and incentivization for price points that make sense… but there is a large-scale market for low priced furniture that will be impacted. Retailers are already losing a great deal of market share to online marketplaces.”\\nThe three other executives interviewed for this report – who are all domestic manufacturers themselves – had more optimism than Williams, but differed in the amount they had.\\nMost hopeful was Doug Bassett, president of Vaughan-Bassett, one of the largest wooden bedroom furniture makers manufacturing in the U.S.\\n\\nDoug Bassett\\n“There is certainly more potential with tariffs in upholstery than with wood, but still, there’s lots of opportunity on the wood side,” he said. “For wood, the main benefactors would be those of us with significantly sized factories.”\\nExisting companies have advantages over those just starting out, Bassett says, largely due to regulation and permitting.\\n“It’s possible to open up a wood factory, but the permitting process, especially for a finishing room, is a multi-year process,” he said. “In order to crank up wood factories, you would also need to streamline the regulatory process.”\\nWhen asked about Williams’ points that there are not enough domestic labor and American-made materials, Bassett gave rebuttals:\\n“There are 330 million people in the U.S., more than three times as many people as in Vietnam,” he said. “And these are also jobs that used to exist. So I wouldn’t say the people aren’t there. Manufacturing used to be double what it is today, at least as a percentage of our economy. Our free trade policies have caused some of that to move overseas. I believe the administration’s vision is to rebuild some of the manufacturing base.\\n“As for materials, 97% to 98% of the materials we use are American-made,” he continued. It’s really only the screws and some hardware that we don’t. All wood is domestic, whether it’s lumber or veneer, as are our finishing materials. At least in Vaughan-Bassett’s case, we’re not an assembly operation.”\\nGat Caperton, president of high-end solid wood furniture manufacturer Gat Creek, also believes tariffs have great potential. But he also believes expectations must be realistic.\\n\\nGat Caperton\\n“Clearly, tariffs could easily be helpful in bringing manufacturing back and protecting more jobs from going overseas,” Caperton said. “But to bring jobs back in a significant way, we’re going to need lots of investment. We need to have factories expand. We’re going to need to build up an entire supply base. In the past 30 years, wood furniture has swung from 10% imports to 90% imports. I think if you collectively bring some tariffs in, we can grow it by 50%, meaning the pendulum can be swung back from 10% to maybe 20%.\\n“So I’m hopeful,” he continued. “I think we can double U.S. production, but I don’t think we’ll ever get it back to where it was in 1990. Even a modest swing though would be great for the industry and for rural workers.”\\n\\nBased in Dundee, Ohio, Mavin sources nearly everything within a 100-mile radius of its factory.\\nDavid Wallace, sales manager at Ohio-based solid wood manufacturer Mavin, thinks the government will have to do more than just tariffs.\\n“I don’t think tariffs alone will bring back a significant number of furniture manufacturing jobs but would expect them to have some effect on factories like Mavin that are bulking up our production team to meet expected demand increases in the near term,” Wallace said. “So much of our furniture manufacturing infrastructure was offshored years ago, and significant investment in new facilities and equipment would be needed for companies to bring it back, which seems unlikely unless they are incentivized by tax/financial assistance in some way.”\\nWallace believes that Vietnam specifically would have to be targeted.\\n“Vietnam has proven to be the perfect fit of craftsmanship and costs for lower priced case goods,” he said. “To keep retails the same and build in the U.S. would likely mean giving up a lot of styling and reducing quality along with a lot of automation. I think it would take a significant tariff being imposed on Vietnam to move this current model, and manufacturers would exhaust other similar offshore options before considering the U.S. again.”\\nHow much potential do tariffs have to strengthen American furniture manufacturing?

In contrast, just 13% said furniture sales would see an uptick before year-end as consumers tried to avoid potential price increases or shortages.\\nOne potential bright spot for domestic producers would be an increase in demand for American-made products, cited by 41%.\\nWhen asked what measures, if any, retailers and manufacturers planned to take in the face of new tariffs, responses fell into these key camps: raise prices, shift or adjust international sourcing, increase domestic sourcing, make inventory adjustments before the tariffs, implement layoffs or downsizing, develop long-term strategies and take a wait-and-see stance.\\nAmong those considering production shifts, specific countries cited as potential new or expanded sources included Vietnam, India and Brazil along with Europe and, more generally, countries with no or low tariffs.\\nConfidence in the actual implementation of the tariffs as proposed is somewhat unclear for both retail and manufacturing leaders who participated in the poll. Although two-thirds said they were very or somewhat confident the tariffs will be enacted as outlined, another nearly 17% believe there will be changes before the new administration takes office in January, and about 18% weren’t sure which way things will go.\\nIf new tariffs are put in place, the impact is likely to be immediate, according to 40% of respondents. A more delayed reaction is expected by 30%, who see impacts occurring within a few weeks and another 19%, who expect the fallout would be felt in a few months’ time.\\nFor the most part, respondents have some ties to China, Canada and Mexico, with one-third noting more than half of their business is aligned with one or more of the three countries. Among all respondents, 57% said they imported or sourced furniture from China, 34% imported or sourced from Mexico, and 18% did the same from Canada.\\nChina (38%) was also the leading source country among those selling furniture, followed by Mexico (33%) and Canada (27%).\\nAsked which industry segment would be most affected by the tariffs, respondents ranked upholstery as No. 1, followed by case goods, furniture components, textiles and mattresses.\\nSee also:\\n\\nTrump threatens 100% tariffs on nine nations – including China and India\\nHow will tariffs impact domestic furniture manufacturers? 4 execs respond\\n\\n:\\nShare this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\nContributor Content ### Webcast: Distributing Consumer Goods in an E-Commerce World It's no secret the digital economy has reshaped the way cons[...] May 20, 2020\\nContributor Content ### Retailers say training’s key for credit programs What’s the key to consumer financing success for today[...] April 6, 2015\\n ### Consumers ‘gloomy’ about future as Expectations Index hits 12-year low Consumer confidence dropped yet again, marking four months o[...] March 25, 2025\\n ### Home furnishings lags behind other categories among online shoppers Among all of the categories that individuals have available [...] March 24, 2025\\n ### Trend tracker says February appeared steady, but ‘underlying disruptions are emerging’ Circana noted that critical changes are occurring among key [...] March 20, 2025\\n ### February another solid month for furniture sales, says DOC The category showed a sharper sales increase than all other [...] March 17, 2025\\nFurniture Today Daily\\nSignup for your daily digest of industry news and trends.\\n\\nBy signing up you agree to our\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\nTariffs\\nRetail\\nFinancial & Business News\\nManufacturing\\nPeople\\nObituaries\\nLicensing\\nResearch\\nSupply Chain\\nEcommerce\\n\\n\\nMarkets\\nEdit Invites\\nAtlanta\\nHigh Point\\nLas Vegas\\nShowtime\\nTupelo\\n\\n\\nProduct & Trends\\nBedding\\nRugs\\nTechnology\\nHome Accents\\nOutdoor Furniture\\nUpholstered Furniture\\nResearch Store\\nEdit Invites\\nBuyers Guide\\n\\n\\nOpinion\\nReader Rankings\\nFurniture Everyday\\nInsider’s View\\nMattress Matters\\nTech Talk\\nLogistics Logic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvents\\nMarkets\\nClassifieds\\nGalleries\\nVideo\\nPhotos\\n\\n\\nPress Releases\\nBTM Business Connect\\nProfessional Announcements\\nBehind The Deal\\n\\n\\nAdvertise\\nAdvertise\\nMarketing Tips\\nGrowth Guide\\nMedia Kit\\nEditorial and Special Products Calendar\\n\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nABOUT\\nFurniture Today is the complete information source for the furniture industry featuring retailer and manufacturing news, plus product trends and market analysis.\\nCONTACT\\n\\nAbout Furniture Today\\nContact Us\\nAbout BridgeTower Media\\nAccessibility Statement\\n\\nADVERTISE\\n\\nAdvertise\\nMarketing Tips\\nFree eGuide\\nMedia Kit\\n\\nCONNECT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\nSign up to get exclusive industry information delivered to your inbox.\\nNETWORK\\n\\nDesigners Today\\nGifts & Decorative Accessories\\nHFN\\nHome Accents Today\\nHome Textiles Today\\nPet Age\\n\\n\\n© 2025 BridgeTower Media.

The American South largely benefited from this shift, not just in wood furniture but also upholstery produced in places like North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi.\\nFollowing this same model, many of us in the industry today witnessed the shift of manufacturing to Taiwan, China and even the Philippines in the early and mid-to-late ’90s to the early 2000s. There, workers would earn a fraction of what they were making to build not just similar products, but products that ended up becoming even more complex in their construction and use of materials.\\n\\nOther lower-cost countries soon also would benefit from this race to lower-cost labor including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and eventually India.\\nUltimately, the products coming from every one of these countries would bring an enhanced fashion statement largely to case goods that showcased highly carved elements along with mixed-media elements from mirrors and glass to decorative marble, metals and more.\\nChina was largely the main source for these looks, but Vietnam soon caught up as many Taiwanese and Chinese-owned plants moved to Vietnam to produce bedroom in response to antidumping on Chinese-made wooden bedroom furniture dating back to 2003 and 2004.\\n\\nOther categories such as home office, home entertainment and dining soon followed as it became more efficient to produce these categories in factories that could match finishes and veneers along with other decorative elements in-house, creating not just a one-stop shop for many customers, but also vertically integrated facilities that were steadily gaining expertise in the fabrication and incorporation of mixed materials into the product mix.\\n\\nThe upholstery segment, which has largely remained domestic, would benefit from the global production of leathers, fabrics and other woven materials used in the mix, not to mention imported frames, mechanisms and motors that are part of the ever-growing motion upholstery segment.\\n\\nMost consumers likely understand that this type of global supply chain has benefited not just the furniture industry, but many other product categories as well, from autos to phones and computers to washers and dryers and refrigerators, to name several.\\n\\nEven the venerable C.F. Martin & Co., which has produced high-end guitars in this country dating back to 1833, has a label on the bracing inside its instruments that reads, “Made in Nazareth, Pa. with Materials Sourced Around the World.”\\n\\nThis is more than just a requirement from the FTC regarding information about where its products are actually produced: made mostly with several exotic wood species — whose tonal properties can calm the soul and even ease a blistering headache — the instrument is a living, breathing testament to reality of the global supply chain.\\n\\nSo here we are once again facing the prospect of tariffs. The ideas being bandied about are not only to raise tariffs on China-made products to 60%, but also potentially impose tariffs on most other countries that could be as low as 10% to 20% but in some cases as high as 100%. Canada and Mexico face tariffs of 25%, as we’ve reported previously.\\n\\nIt’s a possibility that has the industry concerned to say the least, although we collectively have to admit that we saw it coming, just as we saw it coming several years ago with the threat of tariffs on China, which were imposed in 2018 to the tune of around 25%.\\n\\nAt the time, many companies were able to move production to other parts of the world, namely Vietnam, which ended up being a major beneficiary as its furniture shipments to the U.S. expanded significantly.\\nFor example, according to Mann, Armistead & Epperson, furniture shipments from Vietnam rose from $4.3 billion in 2018 to just over $10 billion in 2021, while shipments from China fell from $19.1 billion to $13.9 billion during the same period. During that same period, wood furniture shipments from Vietnam would eclipse those from China, rising from $3.3 billion in 2018 to nearly $5.8 billion in 2021. China’s furniture shipments, meanwhile, fell from $5.7 billion to $2.7 billion during the same period.\\n\\nIf tariffs are imposed as anticipated, it’s unclear what the outcome will look like, although some retail customers have reportedly been shopping domestic sources. That’s a good thing for American companies and U.S. workers as it could help bring some jobs back to the U.S., which is among the key goals of tariffs in the first place.\\n\\nThe challenge for the furniture industry is that most of the manufacturing and jobs have long since disappeared, with only a handful of key players on the wood side of the business. While the domestic producers we’ve spoken with are eager and able to take on some of that business moving forward, there will be some other challenges.\\n+ U.S. wood production capacity is nowhere near what it was before the shift in manufacturing to Asia. With many plant closings and thousands of jobs lost in the process, it would take years to rebuild a furniture manufacturing base. Most banks for one would probably never fund such a thing, given what they know about the industry’s draw to low-cost labor. Thus, the investment would be considered risky at best should tariffs decrease and retailers once again push for lower-cost product from Asia. That’s not to say that existing producers would not continue to survive and thrive with increased demand. It’s just unlikely that we will see much future investment in new start-up wood furniture plants.\\n+ Many younger workers have seen the devastation and havoc the industry imposed on their parents and grandparents whose jobs were lost during the transition to Asia. Hence while many younger workers are still entering the furniture workforce, it’s likely in product development, sales, marketing and retail. For many, working in a furniture plant is nowhere near as attractive as it was a generation or two ago, particularly on the wood side of the business. The question then becomes, who would fill these jobs? Plus, with an increase in automation and robotics, there may not be as many jobs for manufacturing workers after all.\\n+ Consumers stand to lose out both in terms of the looks and overall values they have come to expect. As we alluded to earlier, Asia has long filled the void in style-driven looks resulting from their ability to incorporate mixed-media elements into the mix ranging from marble and stone to metal, glass and mirrored accents made popular by collections ranging from Tommy Bahama at Lexington, Jessica McClintock at American Drew to Jane Seymour at AICO. Most U.S. wood plants simply don’t work with these materials any longer. Thus, we’ve come to see a host of clean-lined designs, some of which are void of much shape, texture or depth. Finish is where many of these producers excel, but that is just one aspect of what many consumers are seeking in design. Of course, luxury furniture producers still provide these types of multidimensional designs, but many of them are still having them produced in Asia.\\n\\nAICO’s Portrait bedroom features this panel bed with marbleized insets that light up. The nightstands on either side also feature marble inset tops.\\n+ With the exception of say Vaughan-Bassett and John Thomas, there also are few other mid-to-upper-middle-priced resources in domestic case goods. What’s produced in the U.S. is either starting-priced promotional, or at the upper end with producers such as Century, Gat Creek, Vanguard and Hickory Chair, to name a few. That leaves a huge void in the middle, where most furniture is sold. Thus with tariffs in place, consumers could either have to become accustomed to the very entry-level starting price points or expect to pay more for their furniture. Of course, some imported furniture still could be affordable, but it will come at a higher price with additional tariffs. So inflation as we know it could reach levels far beyond what all the critics of the Biden administration ever dreamed.\\n+ Upholstery is a bright spot for the U.S. consumer as there are plenty of domestic manufacturers across nearly every price point in places such as North Carolina, Virginia and Mississippi, for example. And those with available capacity could take on even more business in the months ahead, which is certainly a positive for those businesses and their employees. But as we’ve noted previously, they too could fall victim to tariffs, particularly those that import components such as plywood frames, fabrics and leathers along with mechanisms and motors for motion furniture. As those components are as vital to the upholstery mix as wood and veneers are to case goods, consumers should expect prices of those goods to increase as well.\\nThese are just several factors for the furniture and other U.S. companies to consider as the issue of tariffs begins to emerge in the coming weeks and months. Fortunately, the industry can begin planning as we’ve heard many are already doing. But given the depth of the global supply chain, this is not going to be an easy one to figure out. And it could end up to be painful not only for suppliers and the retailers they serve, but also consumers who truly believed the inflated sales pitch that they were going to be better off than they’ve been in the past several years.\\nPost navigation\\nPrevious Post Previous post: The drive to succeed: Partnering with automakers\\nNext Post Next post: The Last Word with Todd Wanek, president and CEO of Ashley Furniture\\n\\nThomas Russell\\nHome News Now Editor-in-Chief Thomas Russell has covered the furniture industry for 25 years at various daily and weekly consumer and trade publications.

The United States has historically relied on some imports of steel and aluminum to keep pace with demand. In 2024, 47% of U.S. aluminum consumption was from imports, and 13% of steel use was from imported steel.\\nHowever, on March 12, a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and derivative products is expected to be implemented.\\nThe Motley Fool has compiled data on steel and aluminum imports to help investors understand exposure, risks, and potential opportunities that come with the tariffs.\\nWhere does the U.S. import steel from?\\nCanada is the top source of U.S. steel imports, followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam.\\nThe United States imported nearly 6 million metric tons of steel from Canada in 2024, roughly 23% of its total steel imports that year. Brazil accounted for 4 million metric tons, or about 16% of all imports. Mexico exported just over 3 million metric tons of steel to the U.S., about 12% of U.S. steel imports.\\nSteel imports from Canada have hovered between 5 million and 6 million metric tons for over a decade, while imports from Mexico have stayed between around 2.5 million and 4.5 million metric tons.\\nSteel imports from China peaked in 2014 at 2.9 million metric tons and have rapidly declined since then due to U.S. tariffs and trade remedies targeting Chinese dumping and subsidies. Steel from China accounted for 1.8% of all U.S. steel imports in 2024, down from 8% in 2014.\\nWhere does the U.S. import aluminum from?\\nCanada is the top source of U.S. aluminum imports, followed by the UAE, China, Russia, and Bahrain.\\nThe U.S. imported just over 3 million metric tons of aluminum from Canada in 2024, roughly 58% of total U.S. aluminum imports that year. Since 2010, Canadian aluminum has accounted for between 40% and 60%, roughly, of U.S. aluminum imports.\\nThe UAE is a distant second, supplying 350,000 metric tons of aluminum to the United States, around 9% of U.S. imports.\\nChinese aluminum imports have fallen by two-thirds since they peaked at 643,000 metric tons in 2017. The U.S. imported 222,000 metric tons of aluminum from China in 2024, about 2% of its total aluminum imports.\\nHow much steel does the U.S. produce?\\nThe United States produced 81 million metric tons of raw steel in 2024, up from 72.7 million metric tons in 2020. The United States is the fourth-largest producer of raw steel in the world, behind China (990 million metric tons), India (150 million metric tons), and Japan (85 million metric tons).\\nHow much aluminum does the U.S. produce?\\nThe United States produced 670,000 metric tons of primary aluminum in 2024, down from 1 million metric tons in 2020 and 1.1 million metric tons in 2019. China is the world’s largest producer of aluminum by far. China pumped out 43 million metric tons of aluminum in 2024. India was a distant second, producing 4.2 million metric tons of aluminum that year.\\nNotably, the United States has the capacity to produce 1.36 million metric tons of aluminum but is using roughly half of it. Just two companies -- Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and Century Aluminum (NASDAQ:CENX) -- are currently producing primary aluminum in the United States across four smelters.\\nWhat investors should know about steel and aluminum tariffs\\nPresident Trump has announced a 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, as well as derivative products, to be imposed on March 12. Unlike the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in 2018, there will be no product exclusions, and the product scope is broader. Prior exemption agreements the United States struck with many major steel- and aluminum-exporting countries will be terminated.\\nSteel and aluminum producers in the United States could stand to benefit from the tariffs -- data shows that U.S. steel and aluminum production increased in 2018 and 2019 when tariffs on those products were in effect. However, there is limited upside given that adding new production capacity to offset higher-priced imports, particularly steel production, would take massive investments and years of infrastructure and talent development.\\nThere is also a risk of foreign retaliatory tariffs, as occurred the last time steel and aluminum tariffs were put in place. That could pose a risk to other sectors of the U.S. economy. Studying which U.S. products major steel and aluminum exporters targeted in response to the previous tariffs would be instructive for investors as the new tariff deadline approaches.\\nSources\\n\\nU.S. International Trade Commission (2025). “Aluminum Import Monitor.”\\nU.S. International Trade Commission (2025). “Steel Import Monitor.”\\nU.S. Geological Survey (2025). “Aluminum Statistics and Information.”\\nU.S. Geological Survey (2025). “Iron and Steel Statistics and Information.”\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n Study: 42% of Parents Aren't Teaching Their Kids to Invest Long-Term Stock Performance in Every Recession Since 1980 The State of LGBTQ Finance: A Survey of 2,000 Americans ESG, SRI, Impact Investing: What Are They, How to Get Started, and How Funds Have Performed State of Streaming 2024: Streaming Services and Consumer Sentiment An Introduction to Digital Real Estate in the Metaverse Average Net Worth by Age, Education, and Race\\nOur Guides\\n Study: 42% of Parents Aren't Teaching Their Kids to Invest Long-Term Stock Performance in Every Recession Since 1980 The State of LGBTQ Finance: A Survey of 2,000 Americans ESG, SRI, Impact Investing: What Are They, How to Get Started, and How Funds Have Performed State of Streaming 2024: Streaming Services and Consumer Sentiment An Introduction to Digital Real Estate in the Metaverse Average Net Worth by Age, Education, and Race Study: Men Are 4x More Likely Than Women to Have Secret Crypto Accounts Study: The Importance of Diverse Investing Role Models Are Alternative Investments the Best Inflation Hedge?

From the escalating cost of raw materials to shifts in demand and production strategies, businesses are adjusting to the new realities of a tariff-driven market.\\nMarch 13, 2025\\nBy Dan Hilliard\\nAluminium Global Steel United States\\nSteel producers, distributors and end users took a range of views on the second round of Section 232 steel and aluminium tariffs on Wednesday March 12, the first day they formally came into effect. The effective tariff increase to 25% hit all imports of steel and aluminium, as well as derivative products made from the metals; prior exemptions and quotas have expired.\\nWhile the threat of tariff pressure has been\\xa0pushing steel prices up\\xa0— in line with\\xa0industry sentiment\\xa0— the overall effect of the tariffs on the health of the steel supply chain remains an open question.\\nSome downstream producers are opposed to pitting an increase in prices against lackluster consumer demand, while others are encouraged by the new tariffs’ inclusion of derivative products.\\n“Including steel derivatives makes a lot of sense,” said Alliance for American Manufacturing president Scott Paul in a March 12 statement. “This addition will ensure that importers can’t game the system and American companies that make these products have a level playing field.”\\nOne steel distributor and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) manufacturer — as well as a long-time tariff supporter — told Fastmarkets that he is concerned that tariff-driven price increases may not hang around without an uptick in demand.\\n“I think the tariffs will continue to cause consumers to ‘panic’ buy, though I don’t know how much longer that will stick without the demand,” the distributor said.\\n“Even though we are getting a lot of calls, many customers are still getting ‘deals’ from service centers that are not raising prices when they should be. If the tariffs end up coming off or being watered down, I could see the price of steel dropping again, especially since scrap for March isn’t as stellar as experts once thought it would be,” the source added.\\nAt the other end of the market, at least two major steel producer trade groups praised the new round of Section 232 tariffs.\\nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) president and chief executive officer Kevin Dempsey praised the new tariffs’ lack of an exclusion process which foreign producers allegedly “exploited as a loophole.”\\n“AISI applauds the president’s actions to restore the integrity of the tariffs on steel and implement a robust and reinvigorated program to address unfair trade practices,” Dempsey said in a March 12 statement. “America must have a sustainable, commercially viable steel industry to meet its national security needs.”\\nThe sentiment was echoed by Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.\\n“As the revised steel tariff goes into effect [on March 12], President Trump is boldly declaring that America will no longer be a dumping ground for cheap, subsidized foreign steel,” he said. “By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America.”\\nLearn more about our reliable data-driven insights, market-reflective prices, forecasts and analysis.\\nWhat to read next\\n\\nAddition of missing soybean crush margin values\\nAG-SYB-0078\\xa0Crush Margin China Soy (Brazil) March 20, 2024:M1:\\xa0104.25 yuan per tonneM2:\\xa063.25 yuan per tonneM3:\\xa043.25 yuan per tonneM4:\\xa0-44.75 yuan per tonneM5:\\xa0-122.25 yuan per tonneM6:\\xa0-132.75 yuan per tonne August 21, 2024:M1:\\xa0-5 yuan per tonneM2:\\xa0-6.75 yuan per tonneM3:\\xa0-50.25 yuan per tonneM4:\\xa0-100.5 yuan per tonneM5:\\xa023.5 yuan per tonneM6:\\xa034.5 yuan per tonne AG-SYB-0079\\xa0Crush Margin China Soy (US Gulf) March 20, […]\\nMarch 28, 2025\\n·\\xa0\\nBy the Fastmarkets team\\n\\nKey talking points ahead of Fastmarkets’ Bauxite & Alumina Conference in Miami\\nFalling alumina prices, geopolitics and a volatile aluminium market will be the hot topics during the Fastmarkets’ annual Bauxite & Alumina Conference, taking place in Miami, Florida on April 2-4.\\nMarch 28, 2025\\n·\\xa0\\nBy Sayaka Kurata\\n\\nOpen consultation on annual methodology review for US pig iron import assessment\\nThis consultation, which is open until April 28, 2025, seeks to ensure that our methodologies continue to reflect the physical market, in compliance with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) principles for Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs).

Manage Subscriptions\\nSubscribe  \\nRight now, the US is preparing to expand a 25% tariff to a wider range of imported steel and aluminum products while also eliminating exemptions for all countries and importers, without exception.\\nThe Trump administration announced the impending tariffs on February 10 on the grounds of national security. They would newly apply to key trading partners, such as the EU and Canada, that so far have been excluded from duties or subject to quotas since the tariffs were first imposed in 2018. US manufacturers and other importers will no longer have recourse to individual exclusions.\\nThe new tariffs go into effect on March 12. They will apply to a range of products, including steel, aluminum, and certain “derivatives” containing the metals that will be taxed based on their steel and aluminum content.\\nThe So What\\nThe new tariffs would have a far-reaching impact on manufacturing costs and supply chains across a range of industries in the US and exporting nations. Current US tariffs will extend to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, which together account for around three-quarters of US steel imports by volume.\\n“Steel and aluminum producers and customers must move swiftly to understand what these tariffs will mean to them and how they can mitigate any negative impact,” says Nicole Voigt, a BCG managing director and partner who co-leads the firm’s work in metals.\\nIf implemented as announced, BCG projects that, once everything is priced in, the new steel and aluminum tariffs would:\\n\\nAdd $22.4 billion to the cost of steel and aluminum products the US imports and up to an additional $29 billion for derivative products.\\nIncrease the affected amount of imported steel from 7 million metric tons to 26 million. With the expansion to “derivative” products, such as elevator parts, bulldozer blades, lamps, and structural steel, the value of goods being tariffed could more than double to $72 billion.\\nIncrease the affected amount of imported aluminum from 2.3 million metric tons to 3.5 million. When derivative products like baseball bats and some aircraft and kitchen appliance parts are included, the value of goods being tariffed would reach $132 billion.\\nMost heavily affect the US metals manufacturing industry, the biggest user of imported steel and aluminum (24% and 35% import dependence respectively). The automotive, mechanical machinery, construction industries, and various consumer sectors will also be significantly impacted.\\nBoost prices and profit margins for US steel and aluminum manufacturers.\\n\\n“Many companies are already starting to update their pricing and optimize their inventory and supply chains, ” says Janice Lee, who co-leads BCG’s global work in metals. “Others are discussing potential capacity expansion.”\\nThese estimates don’t account for retaliatory actions taken by US trading partners and counter measures the US may take in response. The EU and Canada have indicated they will retaliate against US exports but have not yet released details.\\nFurther trade actions may come. For instance, the February 10 executive order provides a mechanism for US steel and aluminum producers and industry associations to seek extending the tariffs to even more derivative goods containing steel or aluminum.\\nUnlike the tariffs imposed in President Trump’s first term, moreover, US steel and aluminum customers will have limited ways to avoid paying the duties. The US has granted more than 100,000 individual exclusions since 2018 to importers that demonstrate limited domestic availability of specific steel and aluminum products. That system for granting or renewing exclusions is now shut.\\nThe Trump administration is taking a different approach to steel and aluminum tariffs than it did in 2018.\\n“This time, there is less dealmaking with countries and no room for companies to get exceptions,” says Iacob Koch-Weser, a BCG associate director who specializes in trade and investment.\\n“The main options are to source domestically or pay more for imported materials. Shifting sourcing locations is less useful if everyone faces the same tariffs.”\\nSubscribe to receive BCG insights on the most pressing issues facing international business.\\nSubscribe\\nManage Subscriptions \\nNow What\\nThe key issues and options facing business leaders largely depend on their place in the value chain.\\nUS steel and aluminum companies in the short term will need to manage change in demand through pricing and adjusting production and inventory. Over the longer term, they should determine whether to invest in more capacity, explore making higher value-added products that have primarily been imported thus far, and improve operational efficiency to remain competitive.\\nUS steel and aluminum customers must immediately calculate the tariffs’ impact on their material costs and their prices. They should identify ways to mitigate impact, such as by documenting their products’ metals content to qualify for lower tariffs, renegotiating with current metals suppliers, shifting to other suppliers, or using alternative materials.\\nExporters of steel and aluminum products to the US should determine whether they can remain cost-competitive in this market, and in which segments. Without the exemptions that existed previously, exporters will need to reassess the competitive landscape. They can also consider diversifying exports to other regions to offset revenue lost in the US.\\nRelated Content\\n\\nInternational Trade\\nArticle\\nJanuary 13, 2025\\nGreat Powers, Geopolitics, and the Future of Trade\\nNew BCG research forecasts dramatic changes in world trade flows in the coming decade as national alliances, rivalries, and aspirations rewire the global economy.\\nLearn More\\n\\nInternational Trade\\nArticle\\nFebruary 13, 2025\\nHow to Prepare for Tariffs and the New Reality of Global Trade\\nIf implemented, new tariffs would affect 44% of all US imports.

While tariffs typically increase costs for businesses reliant on imports, they can also create opportunities for domestic companies that benefit from reduced foreign competition or government incentives.\\nFor financial advisors and asset managers, understanding which sectors stand to gain from these policy changes is crucial for identifying investment opportunities and mitigating portfolio risks.\\nThis analysis will highlight:\\n\\nThe industries and companies that could benefit from tariff-related protectionism\\nKey ETFs and funds with exposure to these outperforming sectors\\nHow financial professionals can navigate investment strategies in response to changing trade dynamics\\n\\n\\nIndustries & Companies Positioned to Benefit from Tariffs\\n1. Domestic Manufacturing & Industrials\\nCompanies with strong U.S.-based production facilities will likely see a competitive advantage as higher import costs make American-made goods more attractive.\\nPotential Beneficiaries:\\n\\nCaterpillar Inc. (CAT) – A major player in construction and heavy machinery, Caterpillar could gain from reduced competition with foreign equipment manufacturers.\\nDeere & Co. (DE) – Agricultural equipment producers may see increased domestic demand if tariffs make foreign alternatives more expensive.\\nNucor Corporation (NUE) & Steel Dynamics (STLD) – As tariffs increase the cost of imported steel and aluminum, U.S.-based steel producers could benefit from higher demand for domestically sourced materials.\\n\\n\\nDownload visual | View chart\\n2. Energy & Domestic Resource Production\\nTariffs on imported energy sources, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or crude oil, could favor U.S. producers and refiners.\\nPotential Beneficiaries:\\n\\nExxonMobil (XOM) & Chevron (CVX) – Large-cap oil companies with strong U.S. production footprints stand to benefit from reduced foreign imports.\\nEQT Corporation (EQT) & Cheniere Energy (LNG) – Natural gas producers and exporters could gain market share as domestic production becomes more cost-competitive.\\n\\n\\nDownload visual | View chart\\n3. Agriculture & Food Production\\nIncreased tariffs on imported agricultural products could provide a boost to U.S.-based food producers and farming operations.\\nPotential Beneficiaries:\\n\\nArcher Daniels Midland (ADM) & Bunge Limited (BG) – These agribusiness giants may benefit from increased domestic sourcing of grains and food ingredients.\\nTyson Foods (TSN) & Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC) – U.S.-based meat producers could see higher demand if tariffs make imported meat less competitive.\\nCF Industries (CF) & Mosaic Co. (MOS) – Fertilizer producers could gain if domestic agricultural production increases.\\n\\n\\nDownload visual | View chart\\n4. U.S. Semiconductor & Technology Firms with Domestic Manufacturing\\nWhile the broader tech sector faces challenges from trade tensions, some U.S.-based semiconductor and hardware manufacturers could see benefits from government incentives aimed at reshoring production.\\nPotential Beneficiaries:\\n\\nIntel (INTC) & Texas Instruments (TXN) – U.S. chipmakers investing in domestic production could see increased demand due to reduced reliance on foreign semiconductor supply chains.\\nMicron Technology (MU) – As a leading producer of memory chips with strong U.S. manufacturing capabilities, Micron may gain an advantage if tariffs disrupt international supply chains.\\n\\n\\nDownload visual | View chart\\n5.

While certain industries stand to benefit, broader macroeconomic factors—such as GDP growth expectations and stock market uncertainty—must be closely monitored by financial professionals.\\n\\nDownload visual | View Chart\\nWhy This Matters:\\n\\nGDP Growth Expectations: The Atlanta Fed GDPNow Tracker provides real-time estimates of U.S. economic growth based on high-frequency data.\\nMarket Volatility (VIX): The VIX index, also known as the “fear gauge,” measures expected stock market volatility over the next 30 days. Spikes in VIX often indicate increased investor uncertainty, which can be influenced by trade policies, corporate earnings revisions, and macroeconomic sentiment.\\n\\nAtlanta Fed GDPNow Tracker vs. VIX (Post-Tariff Announcement)\\n\\nWhy It Matters: This chart visualizes how tariff announcements influence economic growth expectations and market uncertainty. A widening gap between higher VIX levels and declining GDP projections could signal increased recession risks for certain industries.\\nWhat to Watch: If GDP expectations drop while volatility rises, asset managers may need to adjust allocations toward defensive sectors, alternative assets, or cash equivalents.\\n\\nPortfolio Takeaways for Financial Advisors & Asset Managers:\\n\\nWatch for GDP growth slowdowns that could impact cyclical industries.\\nMonitor VIX spikes as signals of increased market risk.\\nReevaluate sector exposure if economic growth expectations shift significantly.\\n\\nBy leveraging YCharts Economic Indicators, financial professionals can track GDP forecasts, analyze market volatility trends, and adjust portfolios accordingly.\\n\\nInvestment Considerations for Financial Professionals\\nWhile tariffs create opportunities for some sectors, advisors and asset managers should consider broader market risks:\\nSector Rotation Strategies\\n\\nShifting allocations toward industries benefiting from protectionist policies can enhance portfolio performance.\\nLeveraging YCharts tools to compare historical sector performance under past trade policies can help guide allocation decisions.\\n\\nPotential Inflationary Pressures\\n\\nTariffs could drive up prices for consumer goods, impacting inflation-sensitive investments.\\nMonitoring CPI trends and inflation-protected securities (TIPS) may help mitigate risk.\\n\\nGlobal Trade Retaliation Risks\\n\\nIf other countries respond with counter-tariffs, industries reliant on exports may face headwinds.\\nAdvisors may want to balance exposure across domestic and international equities.\\n\\n\\nHow YCharts Helps Financial Professionals Navigate Trade Policy Impacts\\nYCharts provides institutional-grade data and visualization tools to help advisors make data-driven investment decisions in response to trade policy changes:\\n\\nTrack Sector & ETF Performance → Use YCharts Fundamental Charts to compare tariff-sensitive industries.\\nMonitor Economic Indicators → Analyze inflation trends, commodity prices, and Treasury yields to assess tariff-related market impacts.\\nGenerate Client-Ready Reports → Create Custom Reports that illustrate the effects of tariffs on different sectors.\\n\\n\\nConclusion: Positioning Portfolios for Tariff-Induced Market Shifts\\nWhile tariffs create challenges for some industries, they also present significant opportunities for U.S.-based manufacturers, energy producers, and defense contractors.

These taxes on imported goods occupy a unique position between foreign and domestic policy. Though often misunderstood, tariffs hold popular appeal as a tool of economic and foreign policy. But for agribusinesses, tariffs are a serious business concern. Understanding tariff policies—and how they affect US producers—is a core element in agribusiness success.\\nTariff positioning versus its practical effects\\nLately, policymakers, in the interest of national security, have favored some degree of protectionism to shield US companies from unfair trade practices. Tariffs designed to protect domestic steel production are among the most well-known of these initiatives.\\nRarely do those favoring protectionism recognize that countries targeted with tariffs invariably respond with retaliatory duties and tariffs of their own. Agribusinesses understand this truth all too well. They withstand the worst of retaliatory tariffs, due to the large share of US export volume that agricultural products represent. It’s estimated that the 2018 US tariff on steel and aluminum imports resulted in retaliatory tariffs that cost US agricultural producers $27 billion from 2018 to 2019. footnoteDisclosure 1\\nThe tariff “bark” may be worse than the bite.\\nPoliticians like to talk of tariffs in terms of protecting American jobs. But unlike voters, elected leaders know better than to expect much of this tough talk to reach fruition.\\nCountries that are subject to tariffs routinely bring disputes to the World Trade Organization (WTO) where they’re often deemed to violate international trade rules. In 2018, when the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from several countries, the exporting countries initiated a dispute. Unsurprisingly, WTO arbiters ruled that the US tariffs were inconsistent with global trade agreements.\\nEven when importing countries do manage to implement tariffs, and global trade policy becomes combative, the effects can be transient. While China’s retaliation to 2018 US tariffs led to a large drop in US agricultural exports to China, the volume has rebounded to a large degree.\\nIn addition, the US government often provides financial aid to food producers to help them weather any trade retaliation. US farmers received $23 billion through the USDA’s Market Facilitation Program in 2018 and 2019 to offset export losses resulting from retaliatory tariffs.footnoteDisclosure 2\\nTariffs are one of many global demand controls.\\nEven with WTO disputes, government subsidies, and the softening effects of time, tariffs do have an impact on US agriculture—and producers should expect to continue feeling their effects. That said, other dynamics could be more influential in shaping demand.\\nThough the US and China may opt to escalate their tariff tit-for-tat game, it plays a relatively minor role in the bigger agricultural trade picture. China’s slowing economy and aging population are already reducing US exports of soybeans and corn. An oversupply of grain in China has driven the country’s orders for US soy down dramatically. As of mid-September, orders for the 2024-2025 season were at one of their lowest points in 16 years.footnoteDisclosure 3\\nTense relations between the two countries are also spurring strategic moves—actions with long-term impacts that are likely to lower trade volumes and minimize mutual dependency. China is intent on ramping up efficiency in domestic agricultural production and investing in the development of Brazilian farmland for corn, soy, and wheat production.\\nProducers have more to watch than tariffs.\\nTariff considerations aside, farmers have plenty of other concerns to keep an eye on this fall. Policy differences around fossil fuels and climate change could meaningfully affect the price of key inputs like fuel and fertilizer. The same issues could impact biofuels, and alternative fuels that are based in agriculture, leaving farmers who produce the inputs to these fuels to sort through ramifications of the latest energy policies. Either way, don’t expect the costs of fuel or fertilizer, or the proceeds from selling biofuel feedstock, to provide\\xa0immediate relief.\\nTo create lasting cost reductions, increase your commitment to new technologies and adopt more efficient farming practices.\\nAnd then there’s the congressional quagmire to consider. The 2018 Farm Bill expired September 30, 2024. Government support is crucial for the many farmers that are under tremendous financial strain. But with the parties divided on policies, programs, and the appropriate focus of funding, it likely won’t be until sometime in\\xa02025 that a new bill is passed.\\nAgribusiness can mitigate the impact of continued tariffs.\\nHow should agribusinesses respond to this uncertainty? Short of strategic shifts into product lines—with less exposure to potential tariff action—there’s not much that will directly reduce the impact of tariffs and other external forces. And for many companies, making those changes, if they’re possible, would take quite a bit of time.\\nEnhance your competitive edge by focusing on what you can control.\\n\\nInvest in AI and machine learning.

The last of these quarterly\\xa0reports for 2024 was released shortly after this year’s election results. With a trade deficit widening and proposed tariffs on the horizon, farmers and ranchers are left grappling with how these shifts might affect their operations and market access.\\nIn this article, we cover key insights from this report and provide commentary on how the incoming administration’s expected policy shifts could influence the U.S. agricultural trade outlook moving forward.\\nKey Highlights from USDA’s Agricultural Trade Outlook for 2025\\nU.S. Agricultural Trade Exports\\nU.S. agricultural exports are projected to reach $170 billion in FY 2025, a $500 million increase from August’s forecast. Gains in livestock and dairy exports ($39.3 billion) are leading this growth, with beef and dairy products performing especially well. Horticultural exports are also on the rise, forecasted at $41.7 billion.\\nHowever, some sectors face challenges. Oilseed exports are expected to decline to $33.5 billion due to reduced demand and competition, while cotton exports are forecasted at $4.3 billion, reflecting a similar downward trend.\\nU.S. Agricultural Trade Imports\\nOn the import side, the USDA projects a rise to $215.5 billion, driven by increased demand for horticultural and tropical products such as fruits, nuts, and sugar. Since 2020, agricultural trade imports have increased as much as 50 percent, while U.S. agricultural exports have increased 22 percent. This widening trade gap can be attributed to a mixture of factors, including but not limited to:\\n\\nA decline in U.S. agricultural exports to China, a top agricultural export market. \\xa0\\nIncrease in U.S. consumer demand for imported agricultural products.\\xa0\\nDrought and severe weather conditions in the U.S. lowering yields and increasing import demand.\\xa0\\n\\nThis growing agricultural trade deficit also underscores the importance of maintaining diversified markets and minimizing trade barriers to sustain export momentum.\\nU.S. Agricultural Trading Partners\\nExports to Mexico are forecast to grow to $29.9 billion, a $700 million increase. Exports to Canada are expected to hit a record high of $29.2 billion due to stronger-than-expected demand for beef, fruits, and vegetables.\\nBy contrast, exports to China are projected to decline by $700 million, settling at $23.3 billion, due to low soybean exports and lagging cotton sales. However, this outlook could be disrupted by new trade policies.\\nAgricultural Trade and Tariff Policy in 2025\\nThe incoming administration’s selection of Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary signals a return to aggressive tariff strategies. Lutnick, a staunch advocate of using tariffs as leverage, aligns with the president-elect’s protectionist vision. Other key appointments, including Jamieson Greer as U.S. Trade Representative and Kevin Hassett as the head of the National Economic Council, further cement this approach.\\nSo far, the administration has announced plans for:\\n\\nA 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico.\\xa0\\nA 10 percent additional tariff on Chinese goods, with potential for higher rates.\\xa0\\nA possible across-the-board 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports.\\xa0\\n\\nMany in the U.S. ag sector are discussing the impacts these proposals could have on the farm community—for better or worse.\\nPotential Impacts of Proposed Tariffs on U.S. Agricultural Trade\\nThere are several ways these proposed tariff policies could influence the future of U.S. agricultural trade. Some say they would widen the trade deficit and increase costs. Others argue they could be a leveraging tool to improve future trade deals and encourage domestic production.\\nMarket Disruptions\\nThe proposed tariffs risk destabilizing trade deals like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and jeopardizing tariff-free trade with two of the nation’s top agricultural export markets. Retaliatory measures from Mexico and Canada could further strain relationships and reduce competitiveness. Additionally, escalating tariffs on Chinese goods risk undermining already declining exports to the U.S.’s third-largest agricultural trade markets.\\nEconomic Implications\\nFarmers reliant on imported machinery, fertilizers, and other inputs may face higher costs, cutting into already tight margins. Consumers and farmers alike could experience inflationary pressures, particularly as retailers like Walmart and Lowe’s warn of price increases tied to rising import costs.\\nFederal Government Support\\nIf tariffs begin to significantly impact farm revenues, the government may renew support programs such as the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) or other subsidies. These programs have historically provided billions of dollars to farmers as compensation for lost trade opportunities.\\nDomestic Production\\nBy making imported goods more expensive, the tariffs could encourage greater investment in domestic manufacturing and agriculture, potentially creating new opportunities for U.S. farmers and ranchers.\\nRenewed Trade Deals\\nIf successful, these policies could reduce foreign tariffs and non-tariff barriers,\\xa0improve terms in renegotiated agreements, or address unfair trade practices or subsidies used by competing nations.\\nManaging Risk Through Agricultural Trade Turbulence\\nOpinions differ on whether trade tariffs will ultimately help or harm agricultural trade in the long run, but experts overwhelmingly agree on one thing—disruption will occur if implemented.\\nHere are several ways you can proactively manage the risk of trade turbulence in 2025.\\n\\nDiversify markets. If you rely heavily on export trade, now is the time to explore emerging markets and reduce your dependence on vulnerable trade channels.\\xa0\\nEngage in policy discussions. Farmer advocacy will continue to play a vital role in shaping trade policy. Reach out to your local representatives and industry groups to ensure your voice is heard.\\xa0\\nStay informed. Monitor developments in U.S. relations with top agricultural trade partners like Mexico, Canada, and China to align your business strategies with evolving realities and adapt as needed. \\xa0\\nPlan ahead. Producers should prepare for potential cost increases and revenue fluctuations by leveraging federal support programs and flexible financing options. Be proactive in discussing ways to better secure your financial stability with your lender if you believe these trade policies could directly impact your operation. \\xa0\\n\\nTrade-Proofing Your Farm Finances\\nThe latest agricultural trade outlook offers both promise and caution. While export growth in key sectors is encouraging, the looming uncertainty of new tariffs could disrupt established markets and strain farm finances.\\nThrough it all, AgAmerica is here to help.

How will tariffs impact this?\\nThe U.S. agricultural trade landscape is facing a year of heightened volatility in 2025. The USDA’s first agricultural trade outlook\\xa0this year predicts a record trade deficit, with agricultural exports expected to reach $170.5 billion as imports climb to $219.5 billion. Shifting global demand, lower export values for key commodities, and new tariffs under the Trump administration are all contributing factors.\\n\\nThe combination of rising imports and stagnant exports signals an uphill battle ahead for newly confirmed U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer. For farmers and agribusiness owners, here is a brief overview of the agricultural trade outlook and dynamics in 2025 that could impact your operation.\\nFirst Quarter Agricultural Trade Outlook in 2025: Key Highlights\\nThe USDA’s latest trade outlook underscores several key shifts ahead in agricultural trade.\\nExports\\nLivestock, poultry, and dairy exports are forecast to rise to $39.7 billion, supported by increasing in U.S. beef and dairy products. Grain and feed exports are expected to reach $37.7 billion, driven by higher corn exports. However, oilseed exports, particularly soybeans, are projected to decline to $32.4 billion due to reduced demand from China and strong competition from Brazil and Argentina.\\xa0U.S. cotton exports are also down to $4.1 billion due to lower volumes.\\nImports\\nAgricultural imports are set to increase to $219.5 billion, $13 billion higher than last year’s record and $4 billion higher than November’s 2025 agricultural trade outlook. This increase is reflected mostly in higher demand for horticultural products, coffee, and processed foods. Rising consumer preference for fresh produce, nuts, and specialty food products continues to drive import growth, particularly from Latin America and Europe.\\nTrading Partners\\nWhile exports to Mexico are on the rise, shipments to China and Canada—the other two leading agricultural export markets—are in decline. Lower-than-expected sales of baked and prepared goods, corn, feed, and distiller grains are to blame for the decline in exports to Canada,\\xa0while competition from South American grain along with increased self-sufficiency efforts are contributing to the decline of U.S. imports to China. Meanwhile, opportunities for expanded exports to Southeast Asia and the Middle East may provide new avenues for U.S. farmers. Countries like Indonesia and Vietnam are showing increased demand for U.S. wheat and dairy products, while Middle Eastern markets are importing more beef and poultry. The European Union export forecast is also up slightly due to strong sales of distilled spirits and tree nuts.\\nThe Tariff Effect on Agricultural Trade\\nWe would be remiss not to address one looming factor that has already begun to impact the U.S. agricultural trade outlook—tariffs. Events are unfolding quickly, but at the time of this writing, here’s a short timeline of what’s officially happened so far:\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2025: An executive order is released that announces a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China. \\xa0\\nFebruary 3, 2025: One day before going into effect, President Trump agrees to delay the 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada tariffs for 30 days, following discussions on border security and drug trafficking enforcement. \\xa0\\nFebruary 10, 2025: President Trump announces 25 percent tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports, effective March 12, 2025, removing previous exemptions. \\xa0\\nFebruary 13, 2025: The administration orders a review of reciprocal tariffs, examining trade balances and foreign tariffs, with a report due in 180 days.\\xa0\\nMarch 3, 2025: Trump confirms that 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports will take effect on March 4, citing border security and trade imbalances. The 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports is raised to 20 percent. \\xa0\\nMarch 4, 2025: In response to the new U.S. tariffs, China announces that it will impose additional tariffs on key U.S. agricultural products. Starting March 10, an additional 15 percent tariff will be imposed on imported chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton. Sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products will be subject to an additional 10 percent tariff. President Trump also announces the U.S. will impose reciprocal tariffs starting on April 2, 2025.\\xa0\\nMarch 6, 2025: President Trump announces that any product covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement coming from Mexico will receive a one-month exemption from new 25 percent duties.\\n\\nThese policies have sparked concerns over retaliatory measures. Canada, Mexico, and China are all critical markets for U.S. agriculture, accounting for nearly 37 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. Higher tariffs could lead to decreased demand and loss of global market share\\xa0for American farm products.\\nIt could also increase input costs for farmers relying on imported goods, such as fertilizers, machinery, and chemicals. Tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico may increase prices on critical farm supplies such as potash-based fertilizers, while higher levies on Chinese goods could drive up the cost of agricultural equipment, pesticides, and animal feed ingredients.\\nIn addition, as both consumers and producers, farmers may feel the impacts of higher grocery store costs if these prices are passed to the consumer as most Americans expect.\\n\\nThis combination will likely put pressure on farm margins this year, making cost management an essential strategy for producers in 2025.\\nMinimizing the Impact of Agricultural Trade Risk\\nWith trade dynamics shifting, there are several strategies farmers and agribusiness owners can implement now to mitigate agricultural trade risk.\\nMarket Diversification\\nExpand exports to alternative markets beyond China, Canada, and Mexico, such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, where demand for U.S. agricultural products is growing. Shifting focus to domestic markets could also benefit U.S. operators who were previously priced out by lower import costs.\\nCost Management\\nStress test increases in input costs due to tariffs and adjust your financial strategy accordingly. Explore bulk purchasing, strategic supplier partnerships, and cost-cutting measures to help ease financial strain.\\nSupply Chain Resilience\\nStrengthen relationships with domestic suppliers and explore alternative sourcing options to reduce dependency on imported goods. Invest in localized supply chains to insulate your operation from trade-related disruptions.\\nAdvocacy and Engagement\\nStay updated on trade policy changes and new federal support programs as they emerge. While temporary relief through the Commodity Credit Corporation is under consideration for farmers affected by tariffs, no official announcement has been made yet. Stay engaged with industry organizations and make your voice heard to ensure the agricultural sector’s concerns are included in policy discussions.\\nSupporting American Agriculture Through Thick and Thin\\nThe 2025 agricultural trade outlook presents both challenges and opportunities. While operations that rely more heavily on export trade will be more directly impacted, secondary impacts of higher input costs could trickle down to other producers as well. The silver lining involves the opportunity within the domestic market, as tariffs could level the playing field and increase the competitive advantage of domestic producers. Either way, farmers who proactively manage costs and explore new markets will be better positioned for success.\\nAt AgAmerica, we remain committed to providing financial solutions and resources that empower farmers to withstand market fluctuations.

Defined as taxes or duties imposed on imported or exported goods, tariffs serve various purposes, from protecting domestic industries to generating government revenue. However, the effects of tariffs are complex and far-reaching, influencing prices, trade balances, and competitive dynamics across industries.\\nFor example, in 2018, the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect local producers. While this boosted demand for US-made steel, it also raised costs for industries relying on steel, like automotive and construction, and led to retaliatory tariffs from trade partners, affecting US exports and global competitive dynamics.\\nIn recent years, tariffs have become a particularly hot topic due to escalating trade tensions and significant policy shifts, especially between the US and its key trade partners. Recent developments, such as the US-China trade war and broader global economic shifts, have prompted renewed debate about the effectiveness of tariffs and their \\xa0impacts.\\nThe current environment of globalization and economic interdependence means that tariffs, even when intended to help domestic industries, often have mixed and sometimes unintended or unanticipated consequences. By understanding how sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, technology and retail can adapt, we can gain insight into the broader economic implications of tariffs and how businesses navigate these challenges.\\nUnderstanding tariffs\\nTariffs are essentially taxes imposed on goods as they cross international borders. They play a crucial role in trade policy, serving to either protect domestic industries from foreign competition or to raise government revenue. By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs can encourage consumers to buy domestically produced alternatives. However, they also have the potential to raise consumer prices and disrupt supply chains.\\nThere are several types of tariffs:\\n\\nThe US has a long history of using tariffs. In the late 19th century, for example, tariffs were a primary source of government revenue. Over the years, however, US tariff policy has evolved, particularly in response to globalization and shifts in political power. Notable recent developments include the Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese imports, which led to retaliatory tariffs from China, sparking a trade war that has had lingering effects on multiple US industries.\\nIndustries most affected by US tariffs\\nManufacturing: Heavy machinery, automobiles, and consumer electronics\\nManufacturing is one of the\\xa0industries most heavily impacted by tariffs, particularly those relying on imported components. Industries such as automotive, heavy machinery, and consumer electronics are deeply integrated into global supply chains, making them vulnerable to tariff increases on imported goods. For example, tariffs on Chinese imports have led to increased costs for companies reliant on electronic components, steel and aluminum.\\nAs a result, many manufacturers have passed these increased costs onto consumers through price hikes. Companies like Ford and General Motors have had to reevaluate their production strategies, with some shifting production to countries unaffected by the tariffs or\\xa0using local suppliers to mitigate the impact.\\nKey success factors for manufacturing professionals:\\n\\nDiversify your supplier base to minimize exposure to tariffs from specific regions and reduce supply chain risks.\\nEnhance inventory management practices to better handle cost fluctuations caused by tariffs and maintain product availability.\\nInvest in automation and technology to lower reliance on imported materials and improve operational efficiency.\\n\\nAgriculture: Farmers and exported goods\\nThe agricultural sector has been hit particularly hard by tariffs, especially those imposed on US exports like soybeans, dairy, and pork. China, one of the largest markets for US agricultural products, retaliated against US tariffs by imposing its own duties on these goods, significantly reducing demand. Farmers have found themselves caught in the middle of these trade disputes, experiencing reduced revenue and uncertainty in global markets.\\nUS soybean farmers, who rely heavily on exports to China, saw a drastic reduction in sales due to the retaliatory tariffs. In response, farmers have sought new markets, while others have had to cut production or shift to alternative crops. The ripple effect of tariffs on agriculture extends beyond farmers, affecting global supply chains and consumer prices.\\n\\nSteel and aluminum: The impact of protective tariffs\\nThe steel and aluminum industries have been at the center of US protective tariff policies, especially during the Trump administration. The intent was to boost domestic production by imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports. While US steel producers benefited from these policies, downstream industries, such as\\xa0construction, automotive, and manufacturing, faced increased costs for raw materials.\\nFor example, while domestic steel manufacturers saw an uptick in demand, companies in industries that rely on steel faced higher input costs. Construction companies, in particular, have to deal with rising material costs, which has led to higher prices for consumers and reduced profit.\\nKey success factors for mining professionals:\\n\\nSecuring long-term contracts with domestic buyers can stabilize demand and provide predictable revenue amidst tariff fluctuations.\\nExpanding value-added services like ore processing enables mining companies to offer comprehensive solutions and strengthen supply chain ties.\\nEnhancing ESG compliance makes mining firms more attractive to sustainability-focused partners, potentially improving investment appeal.\\n\\nIndustries less affected by US tariffs\\nTechnology and software: Focus on digital products\\nThe technology and software industry, which relies heavily on digital products and services, has been relatively insulated from the direct impact of tariffs. Software, cloud services, and digital platforms, for instance, are not typically subject to traditional tariff regulations. However, segments of the tech industry that depend on physical components—such as hardware manufacturers, semiconductor producers, and electronics makers—are more vulnerable to tariffs on imported goods. For example, manufacturers of smartphones, laptops, and networking equipment often source parts from multiple countries, making them more exposed to tariffs on imports like chips and screens.\\nIn contrast, companies focused purely on software and cloud infrastructure, like Google and Microsoft, are less affected by tariffs on physical goods but may still feel the impact of trade restrictions if data localization laws or digital service taxes arise. As global supply chains shift, the physical side of tech often faces added costs, while digital-focused areas remain comparatively shielded, enabling a more flexible adaptation to trade barriers.\\nThe global nature of the technology industry also allows companies to adapt more flexibly to trade barriers by moving production or services across borders. For example, companies like Google and Microsoft can provide digital products that are less susceptible to tariffs than physical goods. Still, global shifts in production often cause domestic job losses as companies move operations abroad to mitigate costs, impacting local economies and labor markets.\\nHealthcare and pharmaceuticals: Shielded by domestic production\\nThe healthcare and pharmaceutical industries are also less affected by tariffs, as many of their supplies and products are domestically produced or exempt from tariffs due to their critical nature. For example, many medical devices and pharmaceuticals are manufactured in the US or within trade agreements that protect them from heavy tariffs.\\nWhile some supplies may be imported, the essential nature of healthcare products has led governments to ensure these goods remain exempt from tariffs to avoid disrupting the healthcare system. As a result, this industry has been largely shielded from the negative impacts of trade tensions.\\nKey success factors for healthcare and pharmaceutical professionals:\\n\\nDiversify sourcing strategies across trade-friendly regions to secure alternative sources for essential products.\\nOptimize inventory for critical items to buffer against supply disruptions and sudden policy changes.\\nBuild strong relationships with reliable suppliers to ensure access to essential goods with tariff exemptions.\\n\\n\\nRetail and e-commerce: Mixed impacts\\nThe retail and e-commerce sectors have experienced mixed impacts from tariffs, largely depending on their reliance on imported goods. Retailers that depend on foreign-manufactured products, such as clothing, electronics, and consumer goods, have faced increased costs due to tariffs. However, the ongoing popularity of e-commerce and digital shopping platforms have enabled many companies to adapt by sourcing products globally or shifting production to countries outside the scope of US tariffs.\\nFor example, retailers like Walmart and Amazon, which operate massive supply chains, have been able to mitigate tariff impacts by diversifying their sourcing and negotiating favorable terms with suppliers. E-commerce has also allowed companies to explore new markets and regions that are unaffected by tariffs.\\nThe economic implications of tariffs\\nTariffs have broad economic implications that extend beyond the industries directly affected. One of the most immediate impacts is the potential for higher consumer prices. As companies pass on the increased cost of imported goods to consumers, this can lead to inflationary pressures, which in turn affect purchasing power and consumer confidence.\\nTariffs can have a ripple effect on global supply chains, disrupting the flow of goods and services which can lead to \\xa0inefficiencies. Industries that rely on complex, multinational supply chains may face delays, increased costs, and uncertainty. In the long term, these disruptions can affect the competitiveness of US industries on a global scale, hindering innovation and economic growth.\\nAdditionally, tariffs can strain international relations and lead to retaliatory measures, further complicating global trade dynamics. As countries impose their own tariffs in response to US policies, industries that rely on exports may find themselves facing reduced access to key markets.\\n\\nFinal Word\\nTariffs remain a powerful tool in shaping global trade policy, with far-reaching effects on various industries. Recent tariff policies have heavily impacted sectors like manufacturing and agriculture, while other industries such as technology and healthcare, have remained relatively insulated. The broader economic implications of tariffs, including higher consumer prices, supply chain disruptions and reduced competitiveness, highlight the need for businesses to adopt adaptive strategies.\\nLooking ahead, the future of US tariff policies remains uncertain, as global trade tensions continue to evolve. However, industries that proactively manage these challenges will be better positioned to navigate the complexities of a tariff-laden global economy.\\nRecommended for you\\n\\nTariffs and Tensions: Analyzing Trump’s Trade Strategy\\nPresident-Elect Trump is poised to take office, bringing along a wide range of sweeping tariffs with the potential to repave geopolitics and the international trade landscape.\\nEvan Jozkowski\\n8 min read\\nUnited States Analyst Insights Data Analysis Tariffs\\n\\nThe Impact of the New UK Global Tariff Regime\\nWhen the UK's transition period with the European Union ends on 31 December 2020, the EU’s Common Tariff Regime is set to be replaced by a new system.\\nChristian Shiba\\n5 min read\\nUnited Kingdom Analyst Insights Strategy Brexit\\n\\nBetter Together: Integrating IBISWorld & RelPro to Support Business Development Initiatives in Banking\\nPairing IBISWorld with RelPro provides a comprehensive prospecting solution for banking institutions.

This response underscores the rising tensions in global trade relations, potentially destabilizing decades of cooperation.\\n\\nEconomic analysts are warning that the tariffs could fuel inflation, driving up the costs of essential goods such as groceries, gasoline, housing, and automobiles, apparel and footwear—issues central to Trump’s campaign promises of reducing living expenses for Americans. There are growing concerns that these policies, while aimed at securing the US economy and borders, could disrupt global supply chains.\\n\\nWith retaliatory actions expected from key trading partners, this escalation poses a critical challenge to US diplomatic relations and could reshape international trade dynamics. This moment marks a defining test of the administration’s ability to balance economic nationalism with the realities of a globalised economy, potentially reshaping both domestic and global trade strategies.\\n\\nImpact of the 25 per cent Tariff on Mexican Textile and Apparel Exports\\n\\nA quick analysis of the export data highlights Mexico’s strong dependence on the US market for its textile, apparel, and footwear industries. The newly imposed 25 per cent import tariff on all Mexican products is expected to significantly impact these key export categories, which collectively account for approximately 85 per cent of Mexico’s total textile-related exports to the United States.\\n\\nThus, the 25 per cent tariff imposition on Mexican goods poses a serious threat to the country's dominant textile and apparel exports, particularly as they constitute a significant share of trade with the US. While businesses may explore alternative markets or cost-cutting measures, the immediate effect could be reduced export volumes, disrupted supply chains, and increased production costs, with broader implications for trade relations between the two nations\\n\\nImpact of the 25 per cent Tariff on Canadian Textile and Apparel Exports\\n\\nAs a USMCA member, Canada has a strong trade relationship with the US in textiles and apparel. Clothing dominates exports, with HS Code 62 (non-knitted apparel) at $617.45 million and HS Code 61 (knitted apparel) at $403.79 million, contributing 24.90 per cent of total exports. Technical textiles (HS Code 59) hold an 18.06 per cent share, reflecting growing US demand for advanced materials in healthcare, automotive, and industrial sectors. Other key categories include:\\n\\nTraditional textiles like wool, cotton, and silk play a minor role, highlighting a shift towards value-added and sustainable products.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, the 25 per cent tariff may reshape North American textile trade, prompting US buyers to seek new suppliers and Canadian firms to explore alternative markets. Adaptation through innovation and cost efficiency will be crucial for maintaining competitiveness.\\n\\nPotential Beneficiaries of US Tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese Imports\\n\\nWith 25 per cent tariffs imposed on Canadian and Mexican textile and apparel exports, US buyers will likely diversify sourcing to lower-cost, tariff-free alternatives.

Moreover, exports of miscellaneous textile products, home furnishings, and apparel returned to 2019 pre-pandemic exports levels.[5] Further, exports to the United States’ largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, not only returned to 2019 levels but actually increased.\\nU.S. general imports of textiles and apparel increased by $16.9 billion (13.3 percent) to $144.6 billion in 2021.[6] Imports of products within all digests in the textiles and apparel sector grew except miscellaneous textile products. Imports of apparel, home furnishings, fabrics, carpets and rugs, and fibers and yarns grew by double-digit rates in 2021 as the U.S. industry began to recover from the initial COVID-19 pandemic-related slowdown and U.S. consumer spending increased from 2020 levels.[7] The largest digest group, apparel, which accounted for over 70 percent of all textile and apparel imports in 2021, saw the largest increase by value, $21.8 billion (27.3 percent), followed by home furnishings and fabrics (increases of $3.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively).\\nU.S. Domestic Exports\\nU.S. exports of textiles and apparel increased by $2.7 billion (18.5 percent) to $17.4 billion in 2021.[8] Apparel, fibers and yarns, miscellaneous textile products, and fabrics led the growth in U.S exports in this sector. The two largest exported product groups were fabrics ($5.5 billion) and fibers and yarns ($4.0 billion), together accounting for over one-half of all U.S. textile and apparel exports. The largest destination markets for U.S. textiles and apparel were Mexico, Canada, and Honduras, which accounted for 57.2 percent of all U.S. exports in 2021. The growth in U.S. exports was driven by downstream demand from apparel and textile product consumers that, in turn, spurred demand for U.S. fibers, yarns, and fabrics from producers in regional trade partner countries.[9]\\nU.S. exports of apparel saw the largest shift by value, increasing $780 million (31.2 percent) to $3.3 billion.[10] A little over 50 percent of U.S. exports of apparel in 2021 went to Canada and Mexico as supply chain disruptions incentivized local and regional sourcing to avoid long lead times.[11] The United States exports a wide range of apparel with the largest single product being knitted or crocheted parts of garments or of clothing accessories, which rose by $204 million to $399 million in 2021.\\nU.S. exports of fibers and yarns saw the second-largest increase of $773 million (23.8 percent) to $4.0 billion in 2021.[12] Certain cotton and synthetic yarns accounted for five of the six-largest exported fibers and yarns products, the largest recipients of which were Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) countries, including Honduras, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala.[13] CAFTA-DR rules of origin stipulate that most inputs used in apparel and other finished textiles traded under the agreement be produced in the member countries.[14] The growth in U.S. exports of upstream textile products such as fiber, yarn, and fabric was driven by rising consumer spending for downstream textile products.[15] U.S. exports also benefited from public and private efforts to support the textiles supply chain within the Western Hemisphere, specifically between the United States and the Northern Triangle region of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. For example, in 2021, at least seven U.S. companies announced investments in U.S.- and CAFTA-member textile manufacturing facilities in an effort to increase textiles trade within the region.[16]\\nExports of miscellaneous textile products increased by $544 million (18.7 percent) to $3.5 billion in 2021.[17] Worn clothing and other worn articles accounted for the largest share (23.5 percent) of all miscellaneous textile exports, and exports of these products grew by 35.3 percent ($213 million) between 2020 and 2021.[18] The United States is the largest global exporter of worn clothing,[19] and the increase in exports is tied to the value of apparel sales. That is, as U.S. consumers purchased more clothing in 2021, people disposed of more clothing as well, resulting in an increase in worn clothing exports.[20] The second-most exported miscellaneous textile product group included N95 respirators and other textile face masks.[21] While exports of these goods climbed 40.0 percent between 2019 and 2020, exports fell by 1.4 percent in 2021 as most personal protective equipment (PPE) made in the United States was used domestically.[22]\\nFabric exports also grew in 2021, increasing by $534 million (10.9 percent) to $5.5 billion. Fabrics made up the largest share of U.S. exports of textiles and apparel products, accounting for 31.1 percent, and within the fabrics digest, nonwoven fabrics made up the largest category of exported products. These fabrics are critical inputs to produce many PPE products, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, and other medical PPE.[23] Mexico and Canada were the largest destination markets for U.S. exports of fabric, valued at $2.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.\\nRe-exports made up 21.8 percent ($4.8 billion) of total U.S. textile and apparel product exports in 2021.[24] Within the apparel digest, re-exports accounted for a larger share, 46.8 percent, of total apparel exports in 2021, slightly lower than 48.9 percent in 2020. The share of apparel re-exports is larger than other textile re-exports as many U.S. apparel brands and retailers use free trade zones (FTZs) as distribution hubs for their products.[25]\\nU.S. General Imports\\nU.S. general imports of textiles and apparel increased by $16.9 billion (13.3 percent) to $144.6 billion in 2021.[26] Imports of products under all digests within the textiles and apparel sector grew except miscellaneous textile products.[27] Imports of apparel, home furnishings, fabrics, carpets and rugs, and fibers and yarns all grew by double-digit rates in 2021, as U.S. consumer spending rose and companies worked to sell excess inventories from 2020 to meet increased demand.[28] The largest digest group, apparel, which accounted for 70.2 percent of all textile and apparel imports, saw the largest increase of $21.8 billion (27.3 percent).[29] Apparel imports increased to above pre-pandemic levels, rising from $92.6 billion in 2019 to $101.5 billion in 2021, reflecting increased consumer demand as many people returned to pre-pandemic activities after COVID-19 vaccines became available.[30] Imports of home furnishings ($15.4 billion) and fabrics ($8.1 billion) also grew by 33.0 and 17.9 percent, respectively, as consumers continued to prioritize spending on household goods in 2021.[31]\\nU.S. imports of textiles and apparel from China, the largest U.S. supplier of textiles and apparel in 2021, decreased by $4.8 billion (9.5 percent) to $45.4 billion. China accounted for a little less than one-third of all U.S. imports and was the largest U.S. supplier of products within each digest except carpet and rugs. Due to the decline in U.S. imports from China, China’s share of total U.S. imports fell from 39.3 percent to 31.4 percent, which was slightly below China’s 2019 share of 33.7 percent. This decline was driven by the steep drop in U.S. imports of face masks from China, which fell by at least $13.1 billion (74.0 percent) in 2021 to $4.6 billion as U.S. demand was primarily met with domestic supply.[32] In contrast, U.S. imports of apparel from China increased by $4.7 billion (19.9 percent) in 2021.\\nCompanies identified multiple challenges with respect to sourcing textiles and apparel from China in 2021. For example, imports from China continued to incur additional duties under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, making the cost of Chinese goods relatively more expensive compared to goods of other countries.[33] In addition, goods produced in the Xinjiang region of China, where 20 percent of the world’s cotton is grown, were banned from U.S. importation under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.[34] Finally, some apparel retailers sourcing from China indicated that they were looking to diversify their sourcing portfolio to include other Asian countries, citing rising costs of production in China.[35] However, this transition has been slow due to limited manufacturing capacity in other countries and U.S. retailers’ established supply chains with Chinese suppliers.[36]\\nVietnam was the second-largest U.S. supplier of textiles and apparel in 2021, making up 11.1 percent of all U.S. imports. Apparel accounted for most U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from Vietnam (93.1 percent), and imports increased by $1.7 billion (12.7 percent) in 2021 to $14.9 billion. Vietnam is a large sourcing hub for many U.S. apparel importers, but multiple factors mitigated larger growth of U.S. apparel imports from Vietnam in 2021. For example, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation into Vietnam’s acts, policies, and practices related to the valuation of its currency.[37] While no additional duties were placed on imports from Vietnam as a result of this investigation, firms expressed concerns over Vietnam’s sourcing costs.[38] In addition to sourcing costs, Vietnam experienced challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many apparel manufacturers shut down due to public safety concerns after cases increased from May to September of 2021, resulting in labor shortages as workers left big cities during the slowdown.[39] Despite these challenges, Vietnam continues to be an attractive apparel supplier to the United States due to its diversified product offerings, strong regional value chain, and comparatively high worker productivity rates.[40]\\nIndia was the third-largest supplier of textiles and apparel to the U.S. market in 2021, with imports increasing by $3.4 billion (44.9 percent) to $11.1 billion. About 40 percent ($4.5 billion) of U.S. imports from India were apparel and another 40 percent ($4.7 billion) were composed of home furnishings and carpets and rugs. India is a major producer of home textiles.[41] The country ranked as the second-largest U.S. supplier of home furnishings and fabric, and the largest supplier of carpets and rugs. U.S. demand for home furnishings, such as bedding, grew in 2021 as consumers maintained enthusiasm for purchasing home textiles that began during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.[42]\\nThe three next-largest U.S. suppliers of textiles and apparel—Bangladesh, Mexico, and Malaysia—all saw increased U.S. import shares in 2021, supplying 5.2 percent, 4.3 percent, and 4.1 percent of total U.S. sector imports, respectively. Nearly all imports (95.3 percent) from Bangladesh were apparel, valued at $7.2 billion in 2021, an increase of 35.7 percent. Mexico supplied primarily apparel, miscellaneous textile products, and home furnishings in 2021. U.S. imports from Mexico increased by nearly 20 percent to $6.3 billion, and its share of total U.S. imports rose slightly from 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent. U.S. imports of apparel from Malaysia also grew in 2021, increasing from $2.9 billion in 2020 to $5.9 billion in 2021. This shift was driven by an increase in total U.S. imports of medical gloves, which grew 191.2 percent from $2.6 billion to $7.6 billion during 2020–21, and of which Malaysia accounted for over one-half of total U.S. imports ($4.3 billion).[43] Disposable gloves were categorized as critical PPE in the defense against COVID-19 and have been in high global demand since the beginning of the pandemic.[44]\\n\\n[1] The Textiles and Apparel sector consists of six product digests.

We deliver timely context and impactful analysis for navigating the fast-moving industry. Behind the Headlines offers a bi-weekly dive into recent top stories.\\nHighlights\\n\\nUS imposed 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico; 10% additional tariff on China.\\nCanada issues retaliatory tariff.\\nChina issues retaliatory non-autos tariff.\\nMexico response expected.\\nPotential for immediate North American production impact of 20,000 units per day.\\n\\nThe stability of the North American automotive ecosystem saw an existential threat turn to action on February 1, 2025. That day, US President Trump signed three Executive Orders regarding trade structures with major new tariffs to be enacted with effect from 12:01 am EST, Tuesday, February 4, on Canada, Mexico and mainland China. These include auto tariffs that will profoundly impact automotive production and sales in North America.\\nBy late afternoon of Feb 3, negotiations with both Mexico and Canada enabled their tariffs to be delayed by a month, while the 10% tariff on goods from mainland China were imposed.\\nNone of the three countries were able to negotiate further delay and on March 4, 2025, the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect. Imports from China are now assessed with an additional 10%, bringing the tariffs under this action to 20%. The only adjustment is that Canadian energy (oil and natural gas) are tariffed at 10% instead of 25%.\\nThese tariffs were to be applied in addition to any current tariffs, which for China includes some products tariffed at most favored nation (MFN) 2.5%, automotive products at 25% already and electric vehicles at 100%.\\nCanada countered with a 25% tariff on an immediate CA$30 billion in US goods, with another CA$125 billion in additional goods tariff planned to come in force 21 days later. Canada had also held off on those tariffs in February, but has implemented them as of March 4 as well.\\nPresident Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Act gives the president broad leeway to assess tariffs under a national emergency, without Congressional approval. Trump declared illegal immigration and smuggling of illicit drugs, fentanyl in particular, as national emergencies, formally identifying the national emergency these tariffs were to address.\\n\\nNegotiations and Delays\\nMexico and Canada negotiated the delay from Feb 4 to March 4 by increasing their activity to stop illegal migration and drug smuggling at their borders. Mexico’s President Sheinbaum agreed to 10,000 troops of the Mexican national guard to patrol the border. Canada’s subsequent agreement echoed the move from Mexico, though Canada’s plan is more robust, more detailed and included a commitment for a CA$1.3 billion investment into improving border security and illicit fentanyl trade.\\nCustoms and Duty Changes\\nAlong with imposing tariffs, a de minimis exemption was set aside on Feb 4. The exemption had meant packages with self-reported value under $800 could be imported without duty; setting it aside immediately caused chaos at customs centers and ports not prepared to deal with the additional volume of packages to\\xa0be tracked and assessed, and de minimus was restored.\\nOn March 3, President Trump addressed this issue, saying the exemption will be lifted as soon as the Commerce Secretary has developed and is ready to implement procedures to handle the workflow. Consumer goods from mainland China will be most severely impacted by this change.\\nAnother key change with these tariffs is that there will be no ‘duty drawback’ integrated into the Canada and Mexico tariffs. Credit for US content in a Canada or Mexico-built vehicle will not be factored into duty calculations; duty will be determined on final vehicle value.\\nProbability of Scenarios\\n70% Probability: A Quick Resolution\\nNow that the 25% tariff scenario has been deployed, we see a 70% probability for a quick resolution. In that case, we would see the tariffs only in effect for 0-2 weeks.\\xa0 We will see some automaker production lost due to supply issues and border gridlock, and short-term OEM production halts. In this scenario, we expect that all lost sales and production is regained in short order.\\nS&P Global Mobility estimates that there are about 63,900 light vehicles produced per day across North America, with 41,700 units produced in the US, 17,600 units in Mexico and 4,600 units in Canada. We estimate that production disruption caused by the tariffs could result in one-third of production being disrupted in the region within one week. This would equate to disruption of more than 20,000 units per day in short order.\\n20% Probability: Extended Disruption\\nHowever, we also see potential for an Extended Disruption if the tariffs are held in place for a six-to-eight-week duration. We see a 20% probability for this outcome. In this case, we will see several high exposure vehicles slow or cease production and for OEMs to conserve inventory and be careful to replenish with ‘tariffed’ stock. OEMs will look to protect profitability by replenishing slowly and keep incentives and discounts very low while aiming to keep pricing strong. We do see potential for product development delays during this period having a knock-on effect into future years. Slowed product development will mean that product launches in later years will be delayed, having impact in some years after this has passed. However, with a six-to-eight-week disruption, we expect most sales and production are compensated for within 12 months.\\n10% Scenario: Tariff Winter\\nThe more dire scenario is a Tariff Winter. S&P Global Mobility currently puts this at a 10% probability. In this case, tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada are integrated long-term into the auto trade structures. This would create an environment of sub-optimal sourcing--vehicles and components produced in Mexico and Canada are currently in those locations because cost and efficiencies are optimal in this arrangement. Moving that production to the US to avoid the tariff also increases the cost of labor for manufacturing, has the potential to further exacerbate a general labor shortage, and could leave automakers with underutilized plants in Mexico or Canada. Though in a Tariff Winter we would expect to see re-sourcing, due to the sub-optimal sourcing increasing the cost of manufacturing, North American light-vehicle sales could decline by 10% for several years with a long-term decline in competitiveness. The decline is likely to be 10% in the US, 8% in Mexico and 15% in Canada.\\nA key issue here is that OEMs and suppliers will only invest capital and resources if there is long-term stability in the trade and source planning environment; a Tariff Winter presumes some level of stability, even at higher costs. In the meantime, the uncertain trade situation may delay development of future vehicle programs. This is particularly true in light of additional emission and fuel economy regulation uncertainty.\\nSummary\\nNow that tariff against Canada and Mexico has been imposed, it will significantly disrupt the economics of the region. S&P Global Mobility sees potential for North American production to be impacted by as much as 20,000 units per day within a week. We do expect to see announcements from automakers regarding potential sourcing considerations which were in the works prior to the tariffs being announced. We may see other changes as well; as example, reports indicate that Honda is re-evaluating a previous plan to add production of the next-generation Civic to its Mexico plant in 2027 and source from the US instead.\\nA full-length analysis is available to AutoIntelligence and AutoTechInsight subscribers through their respective web portals.\\nPlan ahead for any possible scenario with S&P Global Mobility's scenario planning consulting services.\\nInquire About Our Scenarios Planning Support\\nThis article w__as published by S&P Global Mobility and not by S&P Global Ratings, which is a separately managed division of S&P Global.\\n\\nContent Type\\nArticles\\n\\nThemes\\nAutomotive Industry Forecast\\n\\nSeries\\nBehind the Headlines\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSales & Support\\n\\nAmericas\\n+1 800 516 2021\\nAsia Pacific\\n+60 4 296 1126\\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\\n\\n+44 (0) 203 367 0682\\n\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\nOverview\\nNews Releases\\nQuarterly Earnings\\n\\nSEC Filings & Reports\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nCustomer Care & Sales\\nSupport by Division\\nReport an Ethics Concern\\n\\nOffice Locations\\n\\n\\nOur Organization\\n\\nCareers\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nLeadership\\nIOSCO ESG Rating & Data Product Statements\\n\\n\\nCookie Settings\\n\\nTerms of Use\\nCookie Notice\\nPrivacy Policy\\nClient Privacy Portal\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\\n© 2025 S&P Global\\n\", 'search_term': 'US automotive industry benefiting from tariffs', 'search_explanation': 'Tariffs on imported cars and automotive parts can benefit US car manufacturers by reducing competition from foreign brands and increasing demand for domestic vehicles.'}, 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/26/business/trump-tariffs-auto-cars': {'title': 'Trump Announces 25 Percent Tariffs on Imported Cars and Parts', 'content': 'In order for tariffs to help boost domestic manufacturing, they must be accompanied by innovative investment in the US automotive industry.\" March 26, 2025, 6:01 p.m. ET', 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-03-26T18:42:26.000Z\\nTrump Announces 25 Percent Tariffs on Imported Cars and Parts - The New York Times\\nSkip to contentSkip to site indexSearch & Section NavigationSection Navigation\\nSEARCH\\n\\nSubscribe for $1/weekLog in\\nMonday, March 31, 2025\\nToday’s Paper\\nSubscribe for $1/week\\n\\nTariffs\\n\\nTimeline\\nWhat to Know\\nMaps: Potential Effects of Trade War\\nRattling Allies\\nAutomakers’ Expensive Choices\\n\\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\nTrump Announces 25 Percent Tariffs on Imported Cars and Parts\\nThe measure is intended to bring car factories to the United States but could increase prices for consumers significantly.

Those tariffs will hit foreign brands as well as American ones, like Ford Motor and General Motors, which build some of their vehicles in Canada or Mexico.\\nNearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as well as nearly 60 percent of the parts in vehicles assembled in the United States. That means the tariffs could push up car prices significantly when inflation has already made cars and trucks more expensive for American consumers.\\nDuring remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said the tariffs would encourage auto companies and their suppliers to set up shop in the United States.\\n“Anybody who has plants in the United States, it’s going to be good for,” he said.\\nBut the auto industry is global and has been built up around trade agreements that allow factories in different countries to specialize in certain parts or types of cars, with the expectation that they would face little to no tariffs. That has been particularly true for North America, where national auto sectors have been stitched together by trade agreements since the 1960s.\\nMexico is the largest source of vehicle imports in the United States, followed by Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany.\\nStock markets fell on news that the auto tariffs would be imposed. Shares of major carmakers tumbled further in after-hours trading, after the White House clarified that the tariffs would also cover imported auto parts. General Motors was down nearly 7 percent and Ford and Stellantis were more than 4 percent lower after the markets closed. Tesla’s stock fell 1 percent in extended trading.\\nMr. Trump argues that the tariffs will increase domestic auto production, but it’s not clear how fast he can accomplish that goal. Tariffs can encourage companies to use more products from the United States and expand production, but new factories typically take several years and can cost billions of dollars to construct.\\nThe additional costs that tariffs will introduce could also backfire economically, harming the U.S. auto industry by squeezing its profits and slowing its sales.\\nThe measure could also set off more trade clashes with foreign countries that send many cars to the United States. And it could invite retaliation on American exports, including cars and agricultural products.\\nPeter Navarro, the senior counselor to the president on trade and manufacturing, told reporters Wednesday that “foreign trade cheaters have turned America into a lower-wage assembly operation for foreign parts.” He added, “That threatens our national security because it’s eroded our defense and manufacturing industrial base.”\\nMr. Navarro singled out countries including Germany, Japan and South Korea, saying they had undermined the ability of U.S. companies to sell their cars abroad. “It’s simply, simply not fair, and that’s going to change,” he said.\\nSome groups praised the tariffs. In a statement, the president of the United Auto Workers union, Shawn Fain, said the tariffs would “end the free-trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades.”\\n“Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions,” he said.\\nBut others said the auto tariffs would hurt the United States as well as other countries.\\n“Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role,” Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said. “This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”\\nThe tariffs have the potential to devastate auto and auto parts manufacturing in Canada, which employs about 125,000 people directly and accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s manufacturing output. About 80 to 90 percent of Canadian production is exported.\\nCanada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, called the announcement “a direct attack,” and said that because of the tariffs the historic ties between Canada and the United States “are in the process of being broken.” Mr. Carney said he would gather his cabinet on Thursday to determine what steps Canada would take in response.\\nThe situation is similarly dire in Mexico, where automotive manufacturing accounts for about 5 percent of the country’s economic activity and employs about one million people, according to Capital Economics.\\nGeneral Motors manufactures some of its Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks in Mexico. Toyota’s Tacoma pickup and two Stellantis models, the Ram pickup and Jeep Compass sport utility vehicle, are also made there. Factories in Canada make the Silverado, Toyota’s RAV4 sport utility vehicle, the Honda CR-V and other popular models.\\nThe administration said the 25 percent tariff would apply to both cars and car parts made in Canada and Mexico, despite the U.S. trade agreement signed with those nations. It created a small exception to those levies, saying any content or materials that originated in the United States but were incorporated into cars finished in Canada and Mexico would be exempt.\\nOtherwise, White House officials indicated that there would be no exemptions, and Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he expected the tariffs to be permanent.\\nGiven the size and importance of the auto industry, the effect of the tariffs will cascade through the economy.\\nAbout one million Americans are employed by auto and parts manufacturers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and two million more are employed at dealers that sell cars and parts. And cars are often the single biggest purchase for American families, meaning that additional costs from tariffs could weigh heavily on consumers.\\nMr. Trump’s decision to impose car tariffs escalates his aggressive trade approach. Since coming into office, he has put an additional 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports from China. He also imposed a 25 percent tariff on almost all goods from Canada and Mexico, before exempting roughly half of those imports, which trade under the rules of the North American trade agreement.\\nMr. Trump plans to introduce more levies next Wednesday, when, he has said, he will announce “reciprocal tariffs” that match the high tariffs and other trade barriers that other countries impose on American exports. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the tariffs would be “very fair” and “very nice.”\\n“We’re going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised.”\\nMr. Trump’s car tariffs will be imposed under an old trade case from his first term, which used a national-security-related legal authority known as Section 232. In 2019, his administration carried out an investigation into car imports and concluded that they threatened national security.\\nIn a presidential proclamation on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the national security concerns had only “escalated” since then. He said revisions he had made in his first term to U.S. trade agreements with South Korea, Canada and Mexico “had not yielded sufficient positive outcomes.”\\nIn a call with reporters on Wednesday, a White House representative rebutted concerns that the auto tariffs could result in a major uptick in car prices, pointing to Mr. Trump’s push to secure a new tax deduction for interest payments on auto loans, which would be limited to American cars.\\nBut most analysts have predicted sharp price increases from tariffs. Before the details were announced, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, estimated that a 25 percent tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada would add $3,000 even to the cost of a car built in the United States, since automakers depend on many foreign components.\\nTariffs would add $6,000 on average to the prices of cars made in Mexico or Canada, a category that includes vehicles like the Toyota Tacoma pickup, gasoline and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox, and several models of Ram pickups, according to Cox estimates.\\nMr. Smoke said higher prices would deter buyers and force automakers to curtail production. He estimated that U.S. factories would produce 20,000 fewer cars per week, or about 30 percent less than usual.\\n“By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Mr. Smoke said Wednesday on a conference call with clients and reporters. “Bottom line: lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”\\nThere could be a temporary benefit for companies, including Ford, Hyundai and Stellantis, that have large numbers of unsold vehicles on dealer lots. Vehicle shortages caused by tariffs will allow them to clear inventory without cutting prices. But the benefit would be short-lived.\\nCarmakers may be able to blunt some of the impact from tariffs because they have designed factories to produce different models on the same assembly line.\\n“Changes in production are always an option,” said Jörg Burzer, a member of the management board at Mercedes-Benz who oversees production at the German automaker.\\nBut it will not be possible for Mercedes to completely avoid the impact of tariffs, which will add substantially to the prices for new cars. Tariffs “would definitely add to the cost, that’s clear,” Mr. Burzer said in an interview in Berlin last week.\\nIn an effort to appease the Trump administration, some foreign carmakers have pledged to expand their manufacturing operations in the United States.\\nHyundai Motor said during an event with Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday that it would invest $21 billion in the United States over the next four years. The South Korean company, which already has large factories in Georgia and Alabama, said the new investments would include a factory in Louisiana to produce steel for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis cars.\\nMercedes, which produces S.U.V.s in Alabama, plans to expand its U.S. operations, Ola Källenius, its chief executive, said in an interview in Rome this month. “We are 100 percent committed to the United States and will continue to be so and are poised to do more,” he said, without giving specifics.\\nSimon Romero, Ian Austen and River Akira Davis contributed reporting.\\nShow more\\n\\nMarch 26, 2025, 10:05 p.m. ETMarch 26, 2025\\nTony Romm\\nTrump says he could cut Chinese tariffs in exchange for a TikTok deal.\\nImage\\n\\nPresident Trump said he could issue another order that grants the government additional time to find a buyer for TikTok.

But the company has been losing market share to vehicles like General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox E.V. and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E.\\nBoth of those electric cars are made in Mexico and will become significantly more expensive because they have more imported parts than Tesla cars. The precise impact is unclear because the administration says any U.S. content in cars assembled in Mexico or Canada will be exempt from tariffs.\\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that Mr. Musk had not influenced his decision to impose tariffs. “He’s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,” Mr. Trump said at the White House.\\nAll automakers, including Tesla, import motors, batteries, raw materials and other parts from other countries.

The United States is the most important export market for Germany’s auto industry.Credit...Laetitia Vancon for The New York Times\\nAfter months of threats, the White House unveiled plans on Wednesday to impose tariffs on automobiles imported to the United States, a plan that is likely to hit car companies across the European Union hard.\\nThe move — which would place a 25 percent tariff on all cars not built in the United States — could ramp up pressure on Europe to respond with countermeasures.\\nEuropean Union officials have already announced plans to allow tariffs that were instituted during President Trump’s first term to snap back into place, and have said they will place a new set of tariffs on a wide variety of American goods — from lingerie to soy products — by mid-April.\\nBut those measures were a response to steel and aluminum tariffs. And their first wave, meant to hit American whiskey and motorcycles, was delayed to allow for more negotiating time and over fears of a stark American response that could crush European wine and Champagne exports.\\nThe latest U.S. move may intensify the urgency for the European Union to retaliate. Automotive tariffs could squeeze an industry that is already vulnerable — especially in Europe’s biggest economy, Germany, which sends American consumers cars from companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. That makes the tariffs a serious escalation in a trade war that has already left Europe scrambling.\\n“I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on European automotive exports,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said in a statement on Wednesday.\\nThe European Union will “assess this announcement, together with other measures the U.S. is envisaging in the next days,” she added, and will “continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.”\\nThe United States is the European Union’s largest export market for cars, accounting for nearly a quarter of all its exported vehicles.\\nIn 2024, European automakers sent 38.4 billion euros’ worth of cars across the Atlantic, down 4.6 percent from the previous year, according to the European automobile makers association, ACEA.\\nAuto tariffs “will definitely be a big bummer for the recently returned optimism in Europe,” said Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro for ING Research. In particular, they could “hurt German exports and increase chances of a continued stagnation.”\\nThe biggest three German carmakers make up about 73 percent of the European Union’s automotive exports to the United States, according to the research firm JATO Dynamics.\\nAnd the United States is the most important export market for Germany’s auto industry. Nearly one of every three Porsches is exported to the United States, while one of every six BMWs is shipped there. Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi (a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group) have production sites in the United States and Mexico, but they would be hard hit by the increase in tariffs.\\nBMW warned this month that it expected that the growing trade conflicts would cost the company $1 billion this year.\\n“If you overdo it with tariffs, it sends a negative spiral to all market participants,” Oliver Zipse, the chairman of BMW, told Bloomberg. There are “no winners in that game.”\\nCars are just one sector facing steep tariff increases. On top of the tariffs on steel and aluminum, the United States is planning to announce what the administration calls “reciprocal” tariffs next Wednesday.\\nThe goal of those, the administration says, is to equalize tariff rates between various nations and America.\\nMaros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Commission, and Bjoern Seibert, the head of cabinet for the commission’s president, visited Washington on Tuesday to talk to their American counterparts — Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative.\\nOn Wednesday, European ambassadors heard an account of those meetings, according to three diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.\\nThe takeaway was that reciprocal tariffs could be in the double digits, two of the diplomats said — perhaps even 20 percent or higher, one added, though the figure was uncertain and the range of estimates wide. The tariffs would apply across the board for E.U. countries.\\n“The EU’s priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs,” Mr. Sefcovic said on X after his meetings this week. “We share the goal of industrial strength on both sides.”\\nAlthough the European Union has a relatively low tariff rate on average, the United States has signaled that it will take other factors into account when calculating reciprocal tariffs — including value-added taxes. Those are consumption taxes added to a good or service at each stage of production, and they are given back to the exporter if a product is exported. Mr. Trump has been a longtime critic of those policies.\\nMr. Trump said while announcing the auto tariffs on Wednesday that the coming reciprocal tariffs would be “lenient” and that “we’re going to be very fair.” He offered few concrete details.\\nA correction was made on\\xa0\\nMarch 26, 2025\\n:\\xa0\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the value of the cars that European automakers sent across the Atlantic last year.

REUTERS/Imelda Medina/File Photo\\nIt seems like \"tariff\" is the word of the moment. Early in his second term, President Donald Trump initially implemented 10% tariffs on goods coming in from China, with an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports coming a few weeks later. Today, he is imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada.\\nThe tariffs will remain in place indefinitely at the President\\'s discretion and may increase if other nations retaliate. There are also threats of tariffs on European imports. All of these tariffs apply to vehicles built in these three countries and to the parts imported from those countries to be used in vehicles that are assembled in the United States. The importer is responsible for paying the tariff when the item (the car, truck, SUV, or component, in this case) comes into the country. The importer, in this case a car company, could choose to absorb the cost of the tariff, but the cost will likely be passed through to consumers in the form of higher car prices.\\nAdvertisement\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nTariffs will still affect car companies that assemble vehicles in the U.S. because components and materials must be imported\\nExperts forecast sticker prices to increase an average of $3,000 per vehicle\\nSome automakers may retool factories or ramp up production in countries where the U.S. does not currently impose tariffs\\n\\nSome car companies will feel more effects from the tariffs than others, but they will all feel the pinch. \"All manufacturers are going to be impacted — even those who are building vehicles in the U.S. have some content from Canada and Mexico,\" said Michael Robinet, VP of forecast strategy for S&P Global Mobility. Of the Detroit Three, Ford assembles the fewest vehicles in other countries, with only 18% of its fleet coming from plants in Canada and Mexico. The remaining two members of this small club, General Motors and Stellantis (which owns Jeep, Dodge, and Ram), import about a third of their assembled vehicles from our neighbors to the north and south.\\nThere are several auto brands that we might still think of as \"foreign,\" but they have strong presences in North America. Honda, Kia, Mazda, Nissan, and Volkswagen all assemble vehicles in Canada and Mexico, while Volvo and its performance EV spinoff company Polestar assemble many of their vehicles in China. Four out of five Hondas built in Mexico are shipped to the U.S., and Volkswagen runs the largest automotive factory in Mexico. All of these companies will have to pay tariffs on vehicles they import from their foreign factories to sell in the U.S.\\nAdvertisement\\nWhen these imported vehicles hit dealerships, you should expect to see higher prices on the window stickers. Many experts estimate an average rise of $3,000 per vehicle. However — and this is important — it\\'s not only tariffs on entire cars, trucks, and SUVs that will drive up prices. Those tariffs apply to materials like steel and aluminum, too, which are the basic materials for building cars. The Ford F-150, to name just one model, is heavily reliant on aluminum.\\n\\n### What Tariffs Mean for Car Buyers For most people facing a short-notice threat of tariffs, the answer is probably to do nothing sudden unless you’ve already done your homework and are fully ready to pull the trigger on a purchase.Jim HenryFeb. 5, 2025\\n\\nEven vehicles that are assembled in the U.S. use parts that come from other companies. Some of these parts come from massive suppliers, such as Magna in Canada or Bosch, a German company with outposts around the globe, including China and Mexico. These companies are large enough that they may be able to absorb the costs of the tariffs rather than pass them on to the auto company.\\nTier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers provide parts like airbags, seat belts, or wire harnesses. These smaller companies might not have the cash flow to shoulder the extra 25% costs on the parts they sell to car companies for assembly in the U.S. Autoliv, a Tier 1 global supplier of safety equipment, has flatly said it cannot afford to take on the cost of tariffs. The company is based in Sweden, but it has facilities in Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as the U.S., Southeast Asia, and Europe.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThis can all seem abstract, so let\\'s look at a couple of examples. The Buick Enclave contains parts and materials made in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Its engine is manufactured in Mexico, and its transmission is made in the U.S. The Enclave\\'s final assembly is stateside, but GM (Buick\\'s parent company) will pay 25% tariffs on the engine and any foreign parts used in that final assembly.\\nThe Honda Civic sedan uses parts from the U.S. and Canada; its engine is built in the U.S., and its transmission is built in Mexico. However, its final assembly is in Canada. That is a complex mix of tariffs on a variety of imported parts as well as the final imported vehicle.\\nRelated:\\nBuying a Car With Your Tax Refund\\nUsually, there is an exemption from tariffs when parts crisscross borders during assembly, like an engine that\\'s partially assembled in the U.S., finished in Canada, and then brought back to the U.S. for final assembly. It\\'s called \"duty remission.\" But the proposed tariffs do not have allowances for duty remission, which is \"almost unheard of,\" said Robinet of S&P Global Mobility.\\nAdvertisement\\nMatt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, went further in saying, “We continue to believe that vehicles and parts that meet the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement\\'s\\xa0(USMCA\\'s) stringent\\xa0domestic and regional content requirements should be exempt from the tariff increase. Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce.”\\nFord has indicated that it can shift work to other U.S.-based plants to lessen its tariff exposure. And the Honda Civic in our example above is also made in Japan, so it\\'s possible the company could ramp up production in that tariff-free (so far) country. Robinet noted that manufacturers have been building their tariff-free inventory over the past few months while they wait to see if and when tariffs could be implemented. Those are the vehicles sitting on lots right now.\\nAdvertisement\\n### US to Announce 25% Tariff on EU Very Soon, Trump Says ReutersFeb. 26, 2025 \\nAutomakers cannot turn on a dime. Firing up an idled facility or retooling a production line takes time, which could mean fewer vehicles are built. That, in turn, could cause a backup in supply similar to what we saw during the COVID-era supply chain troubles. Lower supply further squeezes new car prices and puts pressure on the used car market, too.\\nAll of this is making it difficult to predict what will happen with the automotive market in 2025. \"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" said Gustavo Flores-Macias, professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.\\nAdvertisement\\nThanks to the USMCA, the 1965 Canada-United States Automotive Products Agreement (known as APTA), and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (known as NAFTA), \"we\\'ve had tariff-free automotive manufacturing for sixty years,\" said Robinet. Over those decades, automotive companies determined where it made sense to build parts and vehicles. Neither of those agreements is in place today, and the proposed tariffs could complicate the entire automotive landscape, no matter where a company\\'s headquarters may be.\\nAdvertisement\\nBrowse Cars\\nSmall Cars\\nMidsize Cars\\nLarge Cars\\nSUVs\\nCrossovers\\nTrucks\\nHybrids\\nVans\\n2025 Nissan ARIYAElectric\\nVolvo XC60Luxury\\nSports Cars\\nConvertibles\\nAdvertisement\\nU.S. News Best Cars Awards\\n\\nBest Cars for the Money\\nBest Cars for Families\\nBest Vehicle Brands\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSave on your monthly payments!

But the auto tariffs alone could add thousands of dollars to the average cost of a vehicle in the U.S. and further dampen demand at a time when the sector is already struggling to manage the transition to electric cars.

The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the Detroit Three automakers, said late on Wednesday that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump’s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"\\nThe AAPC added that it is \"critical\" that the tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids price hikes for consumers.\\nIt may take some time before dealers and consumers see major shortages.

New steep import tariffs are scheduled to be imposed on these companies in June 2024. The issue has pitted key constituencies of the energy transition against one another. Some manufacturing groups have applauded[1] the DOC’s decision as cracking down on unfair Chinese trade practices, while some clean energy advocates have decried it for its potential to raise prices and slow solar deployments. The Solar Energy Industries Association said[2] this case unnecessarily put the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk.\\nIn this Q&A, the authors explore the potential implications of the forthcoming tariffs at a time when the US is attempting to accelerate its transition to clean energy.\\nHow did these new solar tariffs come about?\\nIn August, the Department of Commerce (DOC) published its final conclusion[3] on a controversial investigation of solar panel parts manufacturers that began in March 2022. Auxin Solar, a small California-based solar panel manufacturing company, petitioned[4] the US government, arguing that Chinese companies are skirting US tariffs on Chinese and Taiwanese solar cells and modules by effectively routing equipment through countries in Southeast Asia that are not subject to the same tariffs. The DOC investigated eight companies and concluded that five are violating the US laws. When the presidential moratorium on new solar tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia expires next June[5], imports of solar cells and modules from these five companies will be subject to the tariffs faced by Chinese solar manufacturers, with the tariff level ranging from 50 percent to 250 percent of the import value.\\nHelp us understand this decision in the context of US goals and global supply chains.\\nSolar energy accounted for 3.4 percent of total US electricity generation in 2022,[6] up from 1.3 percent five years earlier. This year, US solar installations are expected to set a record of 32 gigawatts (GW),[7] which is more than a 50 percent jump from last year. The pace of deployment likely needs to accelerate to achieve President Biden’s goal of 100 percent carbon-free electricity generation by 2035. According to a Department of Energy analysis,[8] solar energy could account for 40 percent of the US power grid in 2035, which would require annual solar capacity additions to almost double from today.\\nChina dominates the global supply chains for solar energy, with its global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeding 80 percent.[9] For instance, polysilicon wafers, which are processed to make solar cells, are almost entirely produced in China. In contrast, US manufacturers account for a small portion of the solar supply chain, and no American factories currently produce[10] solar wafers or cells at scale.\\nFor over a decade, solar supply chains have been a focus of US policy. Collectively, these measures reflect:\\n\\nConcerns about the resiliency of supply chains given the overwhelming reliance on a single country;\\nConcerns in particular about the reliance on China;\\nConcerns about unfair trade practices from foreign exporters;\\nAspirations to build a strong domestic solar manufacturing industry to serve as an important source of high-quality jobs and productivity in a decarbonizing world.\\n\\nWhere do these new tariffs fit in?\\nRecent US presidential administrations from both parties have levied tariffs on imported solar panels.\\nIn 2012,[11] the Obama administration imposed tariffs on Chinese solar manufacturers under anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. AD/CVD aims to address the competitive advantage foreign firms receive either from government subsidies or from selling products abroad at lower prices than in domestic markets. In 2015, these tariffs were amended and expanded, largely due to attempts to circumvent the 2012 tariffs. Since the imposition of the Obama-era tariffs, the share of US solar equipment imports directly from China has been almost completely phased out, with imports shifting to Southeast Asia. The recent DOC decision would expand these AD/CVD tariffs to cover imports from certain companies in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. These four countries accounted for more than 75 percent[12] of total US solar panel imports last year.\\nThe AD/CVD are just one of many categories of tariffs or import restrictions applied to Chinese solar equipment. Others include:\\n\\nTariffs under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, which enables[13] a president to impose temporary trade measures when a surge of imports threatens serious injury to a US industry. President Trump imposed these “safeguard” tariffs in 2018, although a subsequent exemption of bifacial solar panels (increasingly used in utility-scale solar) and increase in the quota that can be imported duty-free has diminished its effects.\\nTariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which enables[14] the US Trade Representative to take actions when trading partners are engaging in discriminatory or unreasonable practices that burden US commerce. President Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent[15] on solar and many other Chinese imports, and President Biden has kept these tariffs in place.\\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, signed by President Biden in 2021, which stops the import of polysilicon (the primary raw material for solar) and other products made in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China.\\n\\nWhat are the trade-offs of additional tariffs to Americans?\\nWithout commenting on the DOC ruling (which is beyond the authors’ expertise), it’s safe to say that tariffs can cut both ways. While they may improve the competitiveness of US solar manufacturers right when the domestic industry is growing from a small base—thanks to incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act—they can harm US solar developers as well, if they raise the costs of imports that are inputs to production. Moreover, often tariffs lead to retaliatory tariffs, which happened when China[16] imposed 57 percent duties on US polysilicon, following the 2012 tariffs, and the US polysilicon production plunged[17] from around 30 percent of global total in 2010 to around 10 percent by 2017.\\nFor US consumers, tariffs are essentially taxes. While their “incidence” (i.e., who bears the costs) may be split between foreign sellers and US consumers, empirical[18] evidence[19] suggests American consumers largely pay the costs. Therefore, while innovation has led to the rapid decline in the costs of solar energy, tariffs have made solar in the US more expensive than it would have been otherwise. It is difficult to isolate the effects of higher prices on deployment, but according to one study,[20] the AD/CVD tariffs alone caused US demand for solar to decline by 17 percent during the 2012 to 2018 period. Less solar in the electricity system could translate to more electricity produced by fossil fuels, and thus higher emissions.\\nWhat will be the effects of the new tariffs?\\nThe effects on solar markets of the additional tariffs next June may not be noticeable. Solar capacity that will not be subject to these additional tariffs is ramping up quickly, including in the Southeast Asian countries on which this decision focuses. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance,[21] solar manufacturers are building over 35 GW per year of wafer-making capacity (wafers are fabricated into solar cells) in Southeast Asia to avoid tariffs. This added supply will likely push down prices, counteracting the effects of the tariffs.\\nBut it should be noted that in a world without tariffs, solar panel prices would likely be lower and investments to avoid the tariffs would be invested elsewhere.\\nHow should policymakers view the broader trend reflected by these tariffs?\\nEven if the incremental effects of the DOC decision are small, it can be viewed as an expansion of a broader policy trend with large implications. The US has taken aggressive actions to diminish the role of Chinese producers in solar supply chains. The costs of solar modules are already two to three times higher[22] in the US than those in Europe. A recent study in Nature[23] estimates that cutting China out of supply chains increases solar module prices 20 to 30 percent compared to a scenario with globalized supply chains. US climate goals are premised on the strategy of making solar and other clean energy technologies cheap; all else equal, more expensive solar makes those targets more difficult to achieve.\\nThese costs may be justified by the benefits of punishing alleged trade violations, reducing dependence on China, or building more resilient supply chains. But these are important trade-offs for policymakers to consider. The implications of additional solar tariffs next June may be small, but similar trade-offs are likely to arise in future decisions given the escalating risks of geopolitical and climate crises.\\n\\nNotes\\n[1] https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/commerce-finalizes-duties-on-asian-solar-panel-makers-seen-as-skirting-china-tariffs.\\n[2] https://www.seia.org/news/commerce-departments-solar-tariff-decision-imperils-clean-energy-boom.\\n[3] https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/08/department-commerce-issues-final-determination-circumvention-inquiries.\\n[4] https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/CommerceAuxinDecision.pdf.\\n[5] https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-biden-use-executive-action-spark-stalled-solar-projects-amid-tariff-2022-06-06/.\\n[6] https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php.\\n[7] https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solar-rebound-installations-seia-record-year/693027/.\\n[8] https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-solar-futures-study-providing-blueprint-zero-carbon-grid.\\n[9] https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains.\\n[10] https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-probe-tariff-dodging-claim-against-chinese-manufacturers-11648500996?mod=hp_lista_pos5.\\n[11] https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-trade/u-s-sets-new-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-imports-idUSBRE84G19U20120517.\\n[12] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/us-china-solar-trade-probe-ruling-to-reshape-billions-in-trade.\\n[13] https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45529/5.\\n[14] Ibid.\\n[15] https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/speaking-sustainability/update-policies-at-cross-purposes-us-trade-policy-creates-cloudy-picture-for-rapid-deployment-of-solar-energy.\\n[16] https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-new-tariffs-hurt-the-u-s-solar-power-industry-1510628400.\\n[17] https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/trumps-solar-tariffs-create-far-more-losers-winners.\\n[18] https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26396/w26396.pdf.\\n[19] https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/543961/WP-22-372.pdf?sequence=1.\\n[20] Ibid.\\n[21] https://www.bnef.com/insights/31019.\\n[22] Ibid.\\n[23] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6.\\nShare\\n\\nShare\\n\\nTopics, Regions, Tags\\nGeopolitics Renewable Energy Asia + Pacific North America solar Southeast Asia\\nMeet the Authors\\nExternal Associates\\nLilly Yejin Lee\\nExternal Associate\\n\\nExperts\\nNoah Kaufman\\nSenior Research Scholar\\nClimate Change Energy Policy Finance & Economics\\n\\nGet the latest blog articles in your inbox\\nSubscribe for the latest updates in Energy Explained.\\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\\nSubscribe\\nRelated\\nMore on Energy Explained Energy Explained\\nGeopolitics\\nEnergy Issues Likely to Top the Modi-Trump Meeting Agenda\\nAs Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes his first\\xa0visit\\xa0to Washington in the second Trump administration, energy will likely take a front seat in United States-India relations.

Those countries — Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia — are responsible for nearly three-quarters of solar modules imported to the United States.\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\\nBecome a Sponsor\\nThe ruling, unveiled Friday, means that new U.S. solar projects may soon be more expensive: manufacturers whose goods run afoul of Obama-era solar tariffs will be subject to additional import duties on their products.\\nThose duties, however, will not begin to be assessed until June 2024, when a waiver put in place by the Biden administration is set to expire.\\nThe cost of solar projects is incredibly important as the U.S. races to zero-out power sector greenhouse gas emissions — currently responsible for a quarter of the country\\'s total — by 2035%20(https:/www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emission).\\nThe world must limit average global warming to about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid the most dire effects of climate change. It is not currently on track to achieve that goal.\\nAlready in the United States, average summer temperatures have climbed more than two degrees since 1970 — and winter averages have warmed more than three degrees.\\n\\nSolar panels in Detroit on Nov. 16, 2022.\\nPaul Sancya / AP\\nThe investigation upended the solar industry, until Biden stepped in\\nThe Commerce Department\\'s investigation, which began in March 2022 in response to a complaint from a fledgling U.S. solar panel manufacturer, has been a major source of friction inside President Biden\\'s administration.\\nThe department\\'s inquiry contributed to a major drop in solar installation forecasts, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, as installers worried that their projects would become cost-prohibitive if the government imposed retroactive taxes or if the cost of future purchases increased.\\n\"Worst-case scenario, you can think about retroactive tariffs of up to 240%,\" Leo Azevedo, a solar procurement manager, told NPR in May 2022. \"There\\'s just too much risk to order panels right now and that\\'s just the end of it.\"\\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm weighed in on the matter during congressional testimony the same month.\\n\"At stake is the complete smothering of the investment and the jobs and the independence that we would be seeking as a nation to get our fuel from our own generation sources,\" Granholm said. \"I certainly am deeply concerned about being able to achieve the goal of getting to 100% clean electricity by 2035 if this is not resolved quickly.\"\\n\\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaks during an address at Brown University on March 15, 2022, in Providence, R.I.\\nCharles Krupa / AP\\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo insisted that her department was legally required to investigate. She said the process, conducted by career staff at the International Trade Administration, was entirely apolitical, despite its impact on the administration\\'s energy agenda.\\nBiden offers a reprieve\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\\nBecome a Sponsor\\nTwo months after the investigation began, Biden stepped in with a compromise. He allowed the investigation into trade abuses to proceed, but waived the possibility of trade duties on solar modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam until June 2024 — granting the solar industry a measure of certainty as it planned new projects while the inquiry was underway.\\nThe president also invoked the Defense Production Act to help expand American solar panel manufacturing and other clean energy technology, and directed the federal government to increase the amount of U.S.-made solar panels and clean technology products it buys.\\nThe president\\'s maneuver ultimately drew congressional backlash. A bipartisan majority passed a bill to strike the president\\'s waiver in May of this year, worried about how the move would impact American manufacturers.\\nThe president vetoed the legislation and it did not take effect.\\n\\nPresident Biden arrives to speak about clean energy at Brayton Power Station on July 20, 2022, in Somerset, Mass.\\nEvan Vucci / AP\\nThe investigation concludes\\nFriday\\'s ruling from the Commerce Department did not come as a great surprise to the solar industry. Investigators had issued a preliminary ruling in December that found four of the eight suppliers under investigation were circumventing U.S. duties on Chinese-made solar cells. The final investigation revised that finding to five of the eight suppliers.\\nThe ruling means that, in order to be exempt from U.S. duties, all solar providers in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia — including companies not specifically investigated by the Commerce Department — must self-certify that they are complying with all trade rules. Those claims are subject to potential audit.\\nSolar industry professionals have largely been hostile to the investigation.\\n\"This tariff case is bad for business and American workers,\" said Abigail Ross Hopper, head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement ahead of Friday\\'s announcement. \"More than 13 years of tariffs have failed to deliver even a fraction of the solar manufacturing investments we\\'ve seen in the last year.\"\\n\"As the clean energy industry continues to leap forward, we should be making it easier to invest, get a job and allow everyday citizens to access clean energy,\" she said.\\nToo soon to tell how the final ruling will reshape the industry\\nBiden\\'s waiver temporarily exempting the solar industry from any new costs associated with the investigations is supposed to allow installers to adjust their supply chains to ensure compliance with U.S. trade rules and buy time for the domestic solar manufacturing industry to mature.\\nDomestic solar manufacturing is set to soar over the next seven years with investments from Biden\\'s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. By 2030, the U.S. will produce 42 gigawatts of silicon-based solar panels from domestically-sourced parts, up from near-zero today.\\nBut once Biden\\'s tariff waiver expires in June 2024, costs could go up, stalling growth in the solar power industry.\\nDomestic manufacturing advocates support the Commerce Department\\'s ruling, and oppose the president\\'s waiver entirely.\\nIn an op-ed published earlier this month, Michael Stumo — who heads the pro-domestic manufacturing group Coalition for a Prosperous America — said that Biden\\'s tariff waiver will lead to more evasion of duties by manufacturers using Chinese components.\\nThe White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Commerce Department\\'s findings or whether the president would consider extending his solar tariff waiver beyond June 2024 to help domestic manufacturers.\\nCopyright 2023 NPR.

A $1 tariff leads to a $1.35 increase in the final prices.\\nTariffs protect domestic manufacturing jobs but reduce overall employment in the industry.\\nTariffs have had a net negative impact on the U.S. solar industry and environment by slowing deployment.\\nTariffs aim to protect domestic firms but increase prices for consumers.\\nA tariff or duty is a tax imposed on imported goods (U.S. International Trade Administration (U.S. ITA)). Trade policies such as antidumping and countervailing (AD/CV) duties aim to protect domestic industries from unfair foreign trade practices, such as selling products at below normal value (dumping) and foreign government subsides (countervailing) (U.S. Custom and Border Protection 2024). In the solar industry, the U.S. imposed AD/CV duties on Chinese solar cells and panels in 2012 (U.S. ITA 2012). In 2014, tariffs were expanded to solar panels assembled using Chinese or Taiwanese cells regardless of country of origin (U.S. ITA 2014, 2015). In 2018, a 30% tariff was imposed on all major solar product exporters to the U.S. (U.S. President 2018; U.S. Trade Representative 2019). This tariff declined 5% each year to reach 15% by 2021. In 2022, the solar tariffs were extended, decreasing 0.25% annually to reach 14% by 2026 (U.S. President 2022). The tariff excluded solar products from Canada and Mexico. Tariffs on Chinese solar cells increased from 25% to 50% in 2024 (The White House 2024).\\nResearch indicates that tariffs increase prices for U.S. consumers, with manufacturers and installers passing the burden of trade tariffs onto consumers (Amiti et al. 2019, Amiti et al. 2020, Houde & Wang 2022). When a $1 tariff is imposed on manufacturers, the final prices of installed photovoltaic (PV) systems increase by $1.35 (Houde & Wang 2022). Similarly, analysis of the 2018 U.S. tariff on washing machines indicate the cost of tariffs is passed to consumers at a rate above 100% (Flaaen et al. 2020).\\nA study of 2018 import tariffs across various goods (steel, aluminum, solar products, and washing machines) found that by December 2018, they had cost U.S. consumers and importing firms $3.2 billion per month in added taxes and $1.4 billion per month in lost economic value (Amiti et al. 2019).\\nTariffs reduce solar industry employment.\\nA study on U.S. solar tariffs found that they reduced overall employment and wages in the U.S. solar industry, as the loss of solar installation jobs outweighed the creation of solar manufacturing jobs (Bollinger et al. 2024). Tariffs increased domestic manufacturing jobs but led to five times the reduction in overall employment. Installation jobs have lower wages than manufacturing jobs, but their economic impact was four times greater than the increase in manufacturing wages, even when considering the difference in pay.\\nA study of duties on solar and wind components between 2011 and 2019 found no evidence of increased manufacturing jobs in these sectors, but jobs in installation, operation, and maintenance grew (Sharma et al. 2022). These were driven by policy incentives and declining technology costs.\\nAs of December 2023, the U.S. solar industry employed 279,447 workers (Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) 2024, Figure 1). Installation and project development accounted for 64% of all solar jobs (178,812 jobs), a 6% growth from 2022 and manufacturing accounted for 12% (33,273 jobs), remaining flat from 2022. While manufacturing jobs depend on domestic panel production, installation jobs rely on both domestic and foreign panel supply (Bollinger et al. 2024).\\nTariffs have slowed down the industry.\\nTariffs provided modest benefits to domestic manufactures (Bollinger et al. 2024, Houde & Wang 2022). After tariffs were imposed in early 2018, domestic solar panel assembly doubled within two years due to manufacturers importing cells tariff-free, but domestic cell production failed to increase (Bollinger et al. 2024).\\nResearch indicates that the absence of tariffs, solar PV demand would have been 17.2% higher (Houde & Wang 2022). From 2012 to 2018, without tariffs, manufactures would have lost $4.6 million in revenue, while installers would have gained $291.8 million (Houde & Wang 2022). Consumers would have saved $369.6 million in solar cost.\\nIn the absence of tariffs, the environmental benefits of avoiding CO2 emissions through the adoption of PV systems would have been $1.2 billion over 25 years (Houde & Wang 2022). This amount was calculated using data on projected reduction in solar power generation due to tariffs, CO2 emissions that would have been avoided with additional solar energy, and the social cost of carbon (SSC). The SSC represents the economic value of reducing one ton of CO2, estimated at $36/ton.\\n\\nFigure 1. U.S. Solar employment growth by sector. Solar employment growth from 2011 to 2023.

and supply gap\\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\\nHIGHLIGHTS\\nTariffs expected to be finalized in June\\nMost new domestic facilities produce modules\\nThe large gap between US solar module manufacturing capacity and the availability of domestic cells, wafers, ingots and polysilicon is prompting concerns that preliminary US tariffs on imported solar cells could disrupt the emerging supply chains they are meant to protect.\\nExpected to be finalized in June, the new tariffs on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam come as the US government again tries to spur a domestic supply chain for the growing industry. The US has already determined that some foreign governments are subsidizing their solar products.\\nMore solar manufacturing facilities are coming online with the support of the Inflation Reduction Act, but so far most new facilities have been for modules because the IRA makes the downstream portion of solar manufacturing the most appealing. It is also easier to stand up production for solar modules than for components further down the supply chain.\\nThe growing domestic module sector has led to a surge of US imports of photovoltaic cells not assembled into panels. Imports expanded to 4,230 MW in the third quarter of 2024, up from 903 MW a year before, with 71% coming from those four countries, according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence Global Trade Analytics Suite. Meanwhile, the US imported 15 GW of panels in the third quarter of 2024, with 80.7% coming from the countries in the trade case.\\n\"Even though we are in a clean energy manufacturing renaissance ... we are still going to need to bring in from some foreign sources, at least cells,\" American Council on Renewable Energy Vice President of Government Affairs Jeremy Horan said in an interview. \"We want to see more domestic production ... but we also have to look at where are we in the supply chain.\"\\nThe importance of a domestic manufacturing industry and tariff support have split the industry between installers and manufacturers for years.\\nInvenergy LLC President and co-founder Jim Murphy is now in the position of being in both markets. Invenergy is a US-based independent power producer with a portfolio composed mostly of renewables but has partnered with Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. Ltd. through a venture called Illuminate USA LLC to manufacture modules in the US at a facility in central Ohio. Murphy also serves as chairman of the board of directors of Illuminate USA.\\nHe said the tariffs would add to the benefits incumbent providers are getting through the IRA by giving them a greater competitive advantage in comparison to upstarts.\\n\"There can be a place for tariffs in trade policy. We get that,\" Murphy said in an interview. \"We just feel like, in particular, this current [antidumping and countervailing duty] case, the motivation is misplaced. On the cell side, where there is no domestic manufacturing, tariffs seem very nonsensical to us.\"\\nBalancing prices, tariffs and domestic incentives\\nAntidumping and countervailing duty petitions filed with the US International Trade Commission and the US Commerce Department will impose new penalties on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells from the four countries, whether or not assembled into modules.\\nThe Commerce Department on Oct. 1, 2024, set initial countervailing duties of 8.25% for Cambodia, 9.13% for Malaysia, 23.06% for Thailand and 2.85% for Vietnam on photovoltaic cell imports. On Nov. 29, 2024, Commerce set preliminary antidumping duties for crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, with general rates at 125.37% for Cambodia, 21.31% for Malaysia, 77.85% for Thailand and 271.28% for Vietnam. Rates can vary by company.\\nMeanwhile, on Jan. 8, the Commerce Department found three new cross-border subsidies from China into Thailand for some Thai manufacturers on wafers, solar glass and silver paste, which raised the CVD rate on products from three companies, according to the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee. Commerce is also investigating cross-border subsidies going into Malaysia, the committee said.\\nThe committee — whose membership includes Convalt Energy LLC, First Solar Inc., Mission Solar Energy LLC, Hanwha Q Cells USA Corp., Meyer Burger Technology AG, REC Silicon ASA and Swift Solar Inc. — filed the petitions with the Commerce Department. If adopted, the tariffs could add 10-15 cents/W for modules, according to a Clean Energy Associates analysis from July 2024.\\n\"Putting duties and tariffs on them are only increasing costs for consumers in the United States,\" ACORE President and CEO Ray Long said.\\nTim Brightbill, a lawyer representing the manufacturing committee seeking the protections, said that with pricing from some imports \"below cost,\" something needs to be done.\\n\"The increased duty rates demonstrate that Thai solar producers are benefiting not only from Thai government subsidies, but also from discounted raw materials received from government-controlled entities in China,\" Brightbill said in a Jan. 9 statement following the finding of the cross-border subsidies.\\n\"You have to have both investment in solar manufacturing, but you also have to have trade enforcement to back up that investment,\" Brightbill said in an interview. \"What we want to see is that unfairly traded products are eliminated from the market, so we\\'re not opposed to trade.\"\\nSolar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition Executive Director Mike Carr said the IRA, domestic content bonuses and tariffs, and other trade actions, are \"a three-legged stool,\" and \"all of those things really have to work together.\"\\n\"This case is important because American manufacturers need a level playing field against China\\'s manufacturers who have gone abroad with subsidies to evade US trade measures,\" Carr said. \"At the same time, the US must create a strong demand driver in the domestic content bonus tax credit for US-made solar components.\"\\nWhile it is cheaper to produce in China because of their subsidies, \"there really isn\\'t a fundamental advantage that they\\'re operating on,\" Carr said.\\nThis is not the first antidumping and countervailing duty petition lobbied against solar imports, but it is the first in the IRA policy environment, which was designed to bolster domestic clean energy manufacturing through incentives.\\n\"The IRA is supposed to allow industry to reestablish itself in North America,\" Davor Sutija, CEO of Germany-headquartered solar wafer manufacturer NexWafe GmbH, said.\\nInvenergy\\'s Murphy said imports are needed because of a lack of sufficient domestic supply for cells, though he would like to see more domestic supply to utilize the domestic content bonus in the IRA.\\n\"We made the decision to get into manufacturing so that we could supplement what we\\'re importing with what we can produce ourselves,\" Murphy said. \"Longer term, we would like to go upstream and have more components of the supply chain coming from our own facilities. But for the near term, for the next several years, it will have to continue to be some mix of import and cell supply.\"\\nWhile domestic manufacturers are trying to get up and running and increase manufacturing capacity, there are concerns that tariffs could hinder this effort.\\n\"It\\'s not helping if it\\'s putting a chill on things and scaring people to take the next step to go further upstream for a fear that actions similar to this one could affect profitability of that further upstream activity,\" Murphy said.\\nThe new tariffs from this trade petition come on top of existing tariffs for the solar industry.\\n\"While the [countervailing duty] tariffs came in lighter than expected, the reverse is true for the just-released [antidumping] tariffs,\" Guggenheim Partners analysts said in a Dec. 2, 2024, note after Commerce released the preliminary antidumping duties.\\nIn a separate trade policy action, the Biden administration on Dec. 12, 2024, imposed higher tariffs on wafers and polysilicon from China and set new tariffs on certain tungsten products from China, potentially adding to US manufacturers\\' costs because such products are not readily available now in the US. The tariff changes took effect Jan. 1.\\nCommerce\\'s final countervailing duty and antidumping rates are to be announced in April, and the International Trade Commission is expected to release its final determinations in early June. Final orders are also expected in June.\\n\\nX LinkedIn Facebook Email WhatsApp\\n\\n\\nTheme\\nEnergy Transition Electric Power Renewables\\n\\nKirsten Errick\\n\\nEditor:\\nDerek Sands\\nRecommended for You\\nMar 27, 2025 #### Japanese Q2 2025 aluminum premium drops 20% QOQ to $182/mt CIF Japan Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the second-quarter premium for imported primary aluminum at $182/mt plus London Metal Exchange\\nMar 28, 2025 #### China releases 12.8 mil mt clean oil products, 5.2 mil mt LSFO export quotas in second batch for 2025 China\\'s Ministry of Commerce issued its second batch of export quotas for clean oil products and low sulfur fuel oil, amounting to 18 million mt,\\nMar 28, 2025 #### INTERVIEW: US hydrogen must be cleaner to compete internationally, says EDF The US slowing down hydrogen infrastructure spending and potentially allowing for\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nOur Purpose\\n\\nOur Values\\nOur History\\nVentures\\nPress Center\\n\\nCareers at S&P Global Commodity Insights\\n\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\nOverview(opens in a new tab)\\nNews Releases(opens in a new tab)\\nQuarterly Earnings(opens in a new tab)\\n\\nSEC Filings & Reports(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nSales & Support(opens in a new tab)\\nSupport by Division\\nReport an Ethics Concern(opens in a new tab)\\nOffice Locations\\n\\nAdvertisers\\n\\n\\nOur Organization\\n\\nCareers\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nLeadership\\nIOSCO ESG Rating & Data Product Statements\\nAbout S&P Global Commodity Insights\\n\\n\\nCookie Settings\\n\\nTerms of Use\\nCookie Notice\\nPrivacy Policy\\nClient Privacy Portal\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information(opens in a new tab)\\n© 2025 S&P Global\\n\\nYour Cookie Controls:\\nS&P Global uses cookies to improve user experience and site performance, offer tailored advertising and enable social media sharing.

Neal Martin\\nThe Impact of U.S. Steel and Aluminum Tariffs: What You Need to Know\\nLast week, the president signed proclamations to ”close existing loopholes and exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on\\xa0steel and elevate the tariff to 25% on\\xa0aluminum.” Significantly impacting the global trade landscape, these measures are the latest in a series of protectionist policies from the Trump administration aimed at boosting domestic production and addressing national security concerns.\\nWhen the tariffs were first introduced by President Trump in 2018, countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom were granted exemptions. According to the White House, these exemptions ultimately weakened the effectiveness of the tariffs. It is the administration’s view that by allowing certain countries to bypass the tariffs, the U.S. unintentionally created loopholes that were exploited by China and other nations with surplus steel and aluminum production, undermining the intent of the exemptions.\\nA White House\\xa0fact sheet provides additional background.\\nWhat’s Happening with the Tariffs?\\nThe reinstated tariffs come with several key provisions and changes aimed at tightening enforcement and ensuring that only U.S.-processed metals benefit from exemptions.\\n\\n\\nReinstatement of Section 232 Tariffs: On February 10, 2025, the president signed proclamations to reinstate a 25% tariff on steel imports and increase the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25%. This decision follows Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. to impose tariffs on goods deemed critical to national security.\\n\\n\\nEffective Date: The tariffs are set to take effect on March 12, 2025. This gives businesses and foreign governments a short window to adjust to the new rules.\\n\\n\\nElimination of Exemptions: Previous agreements that allowed countries to avoid the tariffs are terminated as of March 12, 2025. Furthermore, the reinstated tariffs apply to a broader range of products, with an emphasis on \"melted and poured\" steel and aluminum, ensuring that only domestically processed metals are exempt.\\n\\n\\nAddressing Duty Evasion: Customs and Border Protection will prioritize reviews of imported aluminum and steel, and impose monetary penalties, in the maximum amount allowed by law, for any discovered misclassification of products.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNo Drawbacks: There will be no refunds and reimbursements of duties collected on goods that are later exported or destroyed.\\n\\n\\nProduct Inclusions: The proclamations direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a process by May 11, 2025, allowing U.S. steel and aluminum producers, as well as industry associations, to propose adding more derivative products to the tariffs. Petitioners must demonstrate that the rising imports of these products threaten U.S. national security to qualify.\\n\\n\\nWhy Are These Tariffs Being Imposed?\\nThe primary goal of these tariffs is to shield American industries from unfair competition, including what the administration argues is global overproduction and market distortion due to foreign dumping (selling goods below market price). Additionally, there is a significant national security concern, as steel and aluminum are crucial for defense and infrastructure projects.\\nThese tariffs are also a key component of a wider strategy to boost U.S. manufacturing and foster domestic economic growth. By increasing the cost of imported metals, the U.S. government aims to encourage local production and lessen reliance on foreign suppliers.\\nImplications for the U.S. Economy\\nThe reinstatement of steel and aluminum tariffs will have far-reaching implications for the U.S. economy, affecting everything from domestic manufacturing to consumer prices and global trade relations.\\n\\n\\nDomestic Steel and Aluminum Producers: The tariffs are designed to protect U.S. manufacturers from foreign competition. In theory, domestic companies will be able to increase their production and expand their workforce, which could have positive effects on the economy in the long term.\\n\\n\\nHigher Costs for Consumers: While the tariffs benefit U.S. producers, they are expected to increase the cost of steel and aluminum-based products, including cars, appliances, and homes. This could lead to higher prices for consumers and disrupt industries that rely heavily on these materials, such as automotive manufacturers and construction companies.\\n\\n\\nSupply Chain Disruptions: Automakers, for example, have already voiced concerns that the higher costs of steel and aluminum could slow production and increase car prices. Supply chain disruptions may also occur, particularly for industries that rely on just-in-time production systems.\\n\\n\\nGlobal Reactions and Consequences\\nThe U.S. decision to reinstate steel and aluminum tariffs has sparked strong reactions from global trade partners, with some countries voicing their opposition and preparing retaliatory measures.\\n\\n\\nCanada and Mexico: These two countries, which were previously exempt from the tariffs, are now subject to them, a move that has raised tensions with the U.S. Both countries have criticized the decision, calling the tariffs unjustified. Canada, the largest exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States, has already threatened retaliatory tariffs, which could escalate trade tensions between the two countries.\\n\\n\\nEuropean Union: European leaders have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the new tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, indicated that the EU would retaliate firmly against the U.S. action. Retaliatory tariffs from Europe could target a range of American products, further straining international trade relations.\\n\\n\\nOther Trade Partners: Many other countries, including major suppliers like Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, are expected to feel the impact of the tariffs. Some may seek to challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO), claiming that they violate global trade rules.\\n\\n\\nThe Road Ahead\\nThese tariffs are part of a larger economic strategy that focuses on reducing reliance on imports while simultaneously protecting key industries in the U.S. However, they come with significant risks—rising costs for consumers, trade retaliation, and potential strain on global supply chains.\\nWhile the full long-term effects of these tariffs remain to be seen, one thing is certain: the international trading landscape will continue to evolve, with nations carefully navigating their relationships with the U.S. As we move forward, it will be essential to watch how these tariffs affect everything from the price of goods to the stability of global trade networks.\\nSubscribe\\nSign up to receive email updates from ML Strategies/Mintz.\\nSubscribe Now\\nPublished\\n\\nFebruary 20, 2025\\n\\nViewpoint Topics\\n\\nTrade & International Affairs\\n\\nProfessionals\\n\\nR.

We appreciate President Trump’s focus and attention on growing and strengthening the U.S. aluminum industry, and there is a lot to like in today’s action. The domestic industry has invested more than $10 billion since 2016 mostly in mid-and-downstream production and recycling. This has been driven by growing demand, a competitive tax environment and strong, targeted trade enforcement the president supported in his first term. For this growth to continue, the U.S. aluminum industry needs two things – long-term market certainty and a reliable supply of affordable metal, which today comes in large part from Canada.”\\nAs articulated in a recent LinkedIn article, America needs aluminum. Aluminum is a critical material for our economy and national defense – used in everything from cars to beverage cans to fighter jets. Today, the United States is investing significantly and will need both smelted and recycled aluminum to meet growing demand. In the years if not decades it will take to build new U.S. smelter capacity, our metal needs must be met by importing.\\nAt the same time, the industry’s decades-long trading relationship with Canada is a good deal for America. The aluminum we import from Canada today is equivalent to the energy generated by at least 4 Hoover Dams. And just one Canadian smelter job supports about 13 U.S. aluminum jobs further downstream.\\n“President Trump’s administration is aggressively pursuing multiple tariff initiatives on behalf of the broader U.S. economy. The U.S. aluminum industry needs certainty in this tariff landscape to support our growth and investment,” added Johnson. “Today’s action closes loopholes in existing Section 232 tariffs that will support our industry’s expansion. However, we encourage President Trump and his administration to deliver a deal with Canada to ensure robust metal supply for U.S. manufacturers and consumers as he did in his first term with the USMCA.”\\nTrade\\n# # #\\nAbout The Aluminum Association\\nThe Aluminum Association represents the full value chain of aluminum production and jobs in the United States, including companies that make 70% of the aluminum and aluminum products shipped in North America.

At a February 2025 press conference in Mar-a-Lago, Trump hinted that the US will impose a 25%+ tariff on pharmaceuticals in the future, after giving time to US companies to build more manufacturing capacity.\\nOn 4 March 2025, Trump imposed tariffs on most imports from Canada, Mexico and China, set at 25% for Canada and Mexico, and doubled on China from 10% to 20%. These could come into effect as early as 2 April. Canada has responded with its own 25% tariffs on a range of US goods. Meanwhile, the US and the EU are trading threats of tariffs on metals and alcohol.\\nOn 26 February, Eli Lilly announced plans to construct four manufacturing sites in the US at a cost of at least $27 billion. Three of the sites will focus on manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), effectively reshoring the company’s small molecule API production. The fourth location will extend Lilly’s injectables production. Other contributing factors for the investment include high global demand for Lilly’s weight loss and diabetes drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide).\\nCanada has responded with 25% tariffs on a range of US goods\\nPfizer is also considering moving overseas manufacturing to its existing plants in the US. Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, stated at the TD Cowen Healthcare Conference on 3 March that if tariffs came into play, “we will try to mitigate by transferring from manufacturing sites outside to manufacturing sites here [in the US].” Bourla described the tariff situation as “volatile…[…] We don’t know what will happen […] We don’t know if the tariffs will be in Canada and Mexico, in China. And clearly, we don’t know what will happen in Europe. But they have other bigger problems now to deal with.”\\nOn 11 March 2025, Merck & Co. opened a $1 billion manufacturing facility in North Carolina to boost production of its blockbuster HPV vaccine, Gardasil. Merck described this as “a crucial component of the more than $12 billion Merck has invested toward US capital investment since 2018, focused on expanding domestic manufacturing and research and development capabilities and creating new jobs in the US, with another $8 billion of US capital investment expected by 2028.”\\nPressure may continue to increase on pharma companies to repatriate production to the US, resulting in higher production costs and potentially an inflationary effect on medicine prices too. Alternatively, if pharma companies are prevented from raising prices, this could result in company profit losses. Many Americans are already facing higher consumer price inflation and rising unemployment, driven by the dual effects of widespread layoffs by the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and trade tariffs, which could result in declining domestic demand for pharma products.\\nRetaliatory tariffs could lead to a decline in exports\\nDrug price regulation may also become more pronounced in markets. In the US, price negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act could become much more entrenched.\\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by target countries will make US products less attractive and could lead to a decline in exports and a potential shrinkage of the US workforce of the most affected companies.\\nMany manufacturers of generics are based in China and India\\u200b; generic and biosimilar prescriptions account for 90% of prescriptions filled in the US. Drug shortages were particularly pronounced in 2024, and tariffs could exacerbate those problems in 2025. There would be significant disruption to the global supply chain.\\nIt is difficult to predict how long-standing any trade tariffs will be, and whether deals can be made to lessen potential disruptions. However, this could be significantly disruptive for companies hoping to supply the world’s largest pharma market, and costly for global consumers.\\nFree Buyers Guide\\nLeading Guide to Pharmaceutical Solid Dose (Commercial Dose) Manufacturing Companies for the Pharmaceutical Industry\\nThe document includes detailed information on the manufacturers and suppliers and their products, along with contact details, to inform your purchasing decision.\\nThank you.\\nYour download email will arrive shortly.

These policies aim to correct trade imbalances and bolster domestic manufacturing, but they also present significant challenges for global pharmaceutical supply chains. This article examines the latest developments, industry reactions, and potential consequences for consumers.\\nLatest Developments in Tariff Policies\\nAs of March 2025, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has introduced a series of tariffs, with a specific focus on China. Key measures include:\\n\\nA 10% tariff on Chinese goods, with considerations of increasing this to 25% on pharmaceutical imports.\\nTemporary suspension of proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico following preliminary trade agreements.\\n\\nThese tariffs, if implemented on pharmaceuticals, could mark a significant shift from the industry’s long-standing tariff exemptions.\\nIndustry Leaders’ Responses\\nPharmaceutical giants are closely monitoring these policy shifts and assessing their potential impact:\\n\\nNovartis: Chairman Joerg Reinhardt stated that while the company is evaluating potential tariff impacts, they are not in panic mode. Historically, pharmaceuticals have been exempt from tariffs, and Reinhardt believes any financial repercussions would be limited at this stage.\\nPfizer: CEO Albert Bourla highlighted that Pfizer could mitigate tariff-related disruptions by leveraging its existing ten U.S. manufacturing sites and two distribution centers, reducing reliance on imports.\\n\\nChallenges for the Pharmaceutical Sector\\nThe imposition of tariffs presents several obstacles for pharmaceutical companies:\\n\\nIncreased Production Costs: Import tariffs on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and finished products from China could raise manufacturing expenses.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\\nThe Trump administration intensified tariff pressure this week, moving to impose 25% levies on Canada and Mexico, and then largely reversing course, and raising the existing Chinese tariffs to 20% across the board. The wide-ranging tariffs are an economic cudgel to achieve political ends, potentially spurring companies to bring manufacturing back to U.S. soil.\\nBut will it work?\\nSome companies, including Pfizer, have already signaled a willingness to move in that direction. Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $50 billion into refurbishing and building facilities in the U.S. to ramp up domestic manufacturing capabilities following a meeting with President Donald Trump.\\nHowever, for generic drug makers, which are hardest hit by Chinese tariffs, slim profit margins and high costs may thwart reshoring efforts, even if they are willing to bring their business elsewhere, said Michael Abrams, managing partner of Numerof & Associates.\\n\\n“Everybody would agree that not being reliant on foreign sources — and China in particular — is a good idea.”\\n\\nMichael Abrams\\nManaging partner, Numerof & Associates\\n\\n“Manufacturers that are opting out of manufacturing certain products because the margins are too thin probably don’t have the capital to go and build their own manufacturing facilities here in the U.S.,” he said.\\nCompanies that make branded drugs could simply absorb the price increases from tariffs rather than take on the high cost of a move because the relocation process takes long enough for the political winds to shift, Abrams said.\\nIn addition, it’s still not clear how the tariffs will play out. Some promised tariffs haven’t materialized yet, and the administration has delayed or scaled back implementation on some while granting exemptions for others, creating broad uncertainty.\\nBringing manufacturing home\\nThe push to bring drug manufacturing back to the U.S. isn’t new or particularly controversial.\\n“Everybody would agree that not being reliant on foreign sources — and China in particular — is a good idea,” Abrams said, noting that the pandemic dramatically illustrated the risks of foreign dependence.\\n“When we were experiencing drug shortages is when we became aware that 72% of APIs in our market were coming from overseas,” Abrams said. “It was a bit of a shock to realize how dependent we were, and there was a real push to do something about it.”\\nKeep up with the story.

The Biden Administration also put money toward reshoring efforts. Even so, there’s been limited progress.\\nCompanies interested in returning to the U.S. could take advantage of existing manufacturing sites that stood idle for years, Abrams said. One survey of 40 generic drug manufacturing sites found that underutilized facilities could produce 30 billion doses of medicines. However, barriers still exist.\\n“It really comes down to the money,” Abrams said, specifically labor costs. “Labor has been more expensive in the U.S. and all the associated regulation that goes with it, and I think that’s the predominant issue.”\\nThe calculus could change if companies gain incentives to move, such as loans or other options to mitigate the risks of acquiring U.S. facilities, Abrams said.\\nCompanies shouldn’t react too impulsively to the tariffs, said Arda Ural, EY Americas industry markets leader for health sciences and wellness. Investing in U.S. manufacturing sites requires significant capital, and companies should weigh the cost against other priorities, such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or technological investments, he said.\\nIn addition, tariffs could ultimately make borrowing money to invest in manufacturing more expensive if they drive up inflation and delay interest rate cuts.\\n“Pharma companies, whether they are generics or branded pharmaceuticals, need to wait for the dust to settle before making those massive capital allocations,” Ural said.\\nRead More in Manufacturing\\nMar 21, 2025How pharma could feel the pain of a recession\\nMar 19, 2025The key factors shaping China’s biopharma boom\\nFeb 19, 2025Merck, Lilly launch manufacturing R&D consortium to help ‘bolster’ U.S. production\\nFeb 07, 2025Tariffs raise concern among generic drugmakers, and advocacy groups are seeking exemptions\\nDec 20, 202410 of our most read articles of 2024\\nDec 18, 2024Big Pharma’s new DTC play: partnering with digital health providers\\nDec 06, 2024Trump’s tariffs could put more pressure on the U.S. to produce generic drugs.

We’re proud to say we never gave up on Made in USA. These tariffs highlight why keeping jobs in America matters—our customers and partners can trust us to deliver quality footwear without the uncertainties of overseas manufacturing. “Tariffs are a fluid situation that we are constantly monitoring,” said, Burns.\\nWhy Thorogood Benefits from the Tariffs:\\n\\nCompetitive Pricing:\\xa0As tariffs increase the cost of imported footwear, Thorogood’s American-made boots offer a more affordable and stable alternative without added duties.\\nReliable Supply Chain:\\xa0Unlike competitors facing delays, factory shifts, and material shortages, Thorogood maintains consistent production in the U.S.\\nConsumer Confidence:\\xa0Customers who want high-quality, American-made footwear can count on Thorogood, free from tariff-related price spikes.\\n\\nWith inflation and pricing concerns top-of-mind for American consumers, Thorogood Footwear emerges as the smart choice for work boots that are built to last—without the risk of overseas disruptions. Thorogood’s commitment to American manufacturing is further backed up by their recent Wisconsin’s Manufacturer of the Year Award, won last month.\\nAbout Thorogood Footwear:\\nThorogood Footwear, a division of Weinbrenner Shoe Company, has been crafting American-made, high-quality work boots for over 130 years. As an employee-ownedcompany, Thorogood remains committed to supporting American workers, providing durable footwear, and delivering industry-leading craftsmanship.\\nFor more information, visit\\xa0www.thorogoodusa.com.\\nPress Contact:\\nAnna Kapla\\nMarketing Operations Coordinator\\nakapla@weinbrennerusa.com\\n651-272-7821\\nEmail: info@fdra.org\\nPhone: 202-737-5660\\nView Privacy Policy\\nDC Office Location:\\n200 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Suite 700\\nWashington, DC 20001\\nNY Office Location:\\n450 Lexington Ave, 4th floor\\nNew York, NY 10017\\n\\n  Notifications\\n', 'search_term': 'US footwear industry benefiting from tariffs', 'search_explanation': 'Tariffs on imported footwear can protect the US footwear industry from cheaper foreign imports, potentially increasing domestic production and sales.'}, 'https://www.modernretail.co/operations/theres-lots-of-concern-why-footwear-is-one-of-the-industries-most-susceptible-to-tariffs/': {'title': \"'There's lots of concern': Why footwear is one of the industries most ...\", 'content': 'PWC estimates that Trump\\'s new tariffs — as well as any reciprocal ones — will cost the footwear industry $5.9 billion a year.

They don’t want to pull production out of Mexico, they said, nor do they want to raise prices. Tariffs aside, “it’s already hard to compete with these large multibillion-dollar companies,” they said.\\nKacy is one of millions of retail leaders trying to find a way forward as U.S. President Donald Trump slaps import tariffs on a wide range of goods. Countries are issuing retaliatory duties in response, and Trump is vowing to enact even more tariffs on April 2. Trump also imposed tariffs during his first term in office, the effects of which are still being felt today.\\nAll of this is a perfect storm for any industry, but particularly for footwear, which is especially susceptible to tariffs. Some 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. today is imported, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade and business association representing more than 500 companies across the U.S. According to the FDRA, the U.S. imports 2.4 billion pairs of shoes a year — enough for seven pairs per person.\\nFootwear, like apparel, largely relies on other countries for manufacturing. Producing footwear requires significant capital, heavy machinery and a sizable workforce — not to mention established supplier relationships, product safety standards and chemical safety oversight. Only a handful of sourcing countries, many of which are in Asia, have the existing infrastructure to accommodate demand. These include China, Vietnam, India and Indonesia. For its fiscal 2024 year, Nike manufactured 50% of its Nike brand footwear in Vietnam, 27% in Indonesia and 18% in China.\\nBuilding this capacity in the U.S. — and thereby avoiding tariffs — would be a tall task. There are dozens of components that go into footwear, and for the U.S. to make an entire shoe at home, it would need to supply everything from cotton for laces to plastic for eyelets to rubber for soles. Developing this supplier base “would take decades,” the FDRA wrote in a March 11 letter to the U.S. government. The country would also have to “hire and train thousands of workers in the intricacies of shoemaking,” the FDRA said, noting that some of its members have already found there to be “a lack of interest [from] workers wanting to work in a shoe factory.”\\nBecause so much U.S. footwear is imported, tariffs are already high. The FDRA estimates that footwear is taxed at an average of 12.3%, compared to less than 2% for other consumer goods. Trump-era tariffs are only exacerbating this, Matt Priest, the CEO and president of the FDRA, told Modern Retail. “We’ve had tariffs in place since 1930, so this is just adding insult to injury,” Priest explained. Meanwhile, Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader at PwC, told Modern Retail that overall import costs for footwear could increase to 40-50% because of new tariffs.\\nKane, a footwear brand that makes recovery shoes, manufactures in Brazil. The company is “praying” that the U.S. won’t enact additional tariffs, its founder and CEO John Gagliardi told Modern Retail. “We can’t control that, but that’s something we talk about,” he said. As a contingency measure, Kane is preemptively increasing the inventory it has on hand in the U.S. “We’re just trying to get more product in before something happens,” Gagliardi said. “But we’re not changing our production.”\\nPWC estimates that Trump’s new tariffs — as well as any reciprocal ones — will cost the footwear industry $5.9 billion a year. Some footwear brands and retailers plan to pass this on to consumers via price increases; ninety-seven percent of respondents to a recent FDRA survey said they would do so. That level is “unheard of,” Priest said. “We’ve done this survey for four years, and it’s the worst outlook we’ve ever published.”\\nThis is worrying because footwear prices are already high, said Beth Goldstein, a footwear analyst with Circana. In fact, footwear prices are up 30% since 2019, she told Modern Retail. Much of that is because of supply chain delays and material shortages due to the pandemic. But, Goldstein said, this is likely to be the new normal.\\n“Footwear is not an industry like food or gas where, when costs go back down, [companies] are going to lower the price,” she said. “The MSRP [manufacturer’s suggested retail price] is now at a high level, … and consumers are already feeling the pain.” If prices increase even more, “we would probably see unit demand start to slide again,” Goldstein said.\\nPriest agreed. “When the import price goes up, the retail price goes up,” he said. “And when you drive up prices, you drive down sales. There’s lots of concern out there in the marketplace, for sure.”\\nBack in November, the National Retail Federation estimated that U.S. consumers could lose $46 billion to $78 billion in spending power each year that the tariffs are in place. For footwear, specifically, customers can expect to pay $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more a year, according to the NRF.\\nWhile Trump may be counting on tariffs to boost products “made in America,” that’s easier said than done for footwear, sources say.\\n“You would think by the political rhetoric [that] the administration really wants to encourage domestic production with the tariffs,” Priest said. However, he noted, the typical sneaker already has an estimated 20% tariff on it, including a 7.5% tariff added during Trump’s last term.\\n“They have rhetoric, but the policy doesn’t line up with that rhetoric,” Priest said.\\n\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nReddit\\n\\nMore in Operations\\nNew Economic Realities\\nModern Retail Rundown: Dollar Tree sells Family Dollar, GameStop bets on Bitcoin & H&M’s profit plummets\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nOn this week\\'s Modern Retail Rundown, the staff discusses Dollar Tree\\'s decision to offload its struggling Family Dollar segment for $1 billion.

And a new study from the National Retail Federation (NRF) has found that if implemented, his tariffs could cost US consumers between $46 billion and $78 billion each year.\\nThe recent study from the retail trade group examined how Trump’s tariffs proposals could impact the following categories: apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods. Trump’s proposed tariff plans include a 10 to 20 percent tariff on imports from all foreign countries and an additional 60 to 100 percent tariff on imports specifically from China. Within footwear in particular, the study found that U.S. consumers could pay between $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more for footwear a year.\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nAs Trump Plans to Double Tariffs on China, Twisted X Pledges to Not Raise Its Prices\\n\\nFDRA’s Matt Priest Says Trump’s Additional 10% Tariff on China Would Be ‘Catastrophic’ for Some Shoe Companies\\nFor example, the study revealed that a $50 pair of sneakers could rise to between $59 and $64 dollars.\\nWatch on FN\\nOn the other hand, Kamala Harris’ tariff policies\\xa0were expected to be a continuation of President Joe Biden’s policies, which included keeping the burdensome Section 301 rates in place, which have also contributed to higher shoe prices at retail.\\n“Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,” NRF’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy Jonathan Gold said in a statement. “A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers’ pockets through higher prices.”\\n99 percent of the shoes sold in the United States are currently imported from primarily China, Vietnam and Indonesia. With the U.S. footwear industry bringing in 2.5 billion shoes a year, it already pays $4 billion a year in tariffs.\\nShoe prices were mostly flat in September from a year ago, but the category is expected to see an overall rise by the end of 2024 for the fourth straight year, according to the latest data from the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA).\\nShoe industry trade groups have been vocal about the adverse effects that tariffs bring to consumers. In September, a survey from FDRA found that tariffs and trade policy were top of mind for U.S. shoe executives in the third quarter.\\n“Our Q3 Shoe Executive Survey reflects both the optimism and the challenges facing the footwear industry,” said FDRA president and chief executive officer Matt Priest in a statement in September. “With trade policy looming large in a presidential election year and consumer behavior constantly evolving, our members are prepared to navigate these uncertainties. FDRA will continue to provide the tools and insights they need to succeed.”\\nRead More:\\n\\n\\nElection Day\\n\\n\\nFDRA\\n\\n\\nTariff\\n\\n\\nDaily Headlines\\nSubscribe\\nYou May Like\\n Email Validation Tools & Email List Cleaning | ZeroBounce www.zerobounce.net | Sponsored  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\\n How Long Does $1 Million Last After 60?

They say more effort could be needed, whether it’s relaxed regulation, tariffs to go higher or a greater effort to build up an American manufacturing workforce.\\nOr all of the above.\\nIn addition to those furniture executives interviewed earlier this month, two more – Kevin Kauffman, CEO of Simply Amish; and Marcus Bontrager, president of Fusion Designs – shared their perspectives with Furniture Today.\\n\\nKevin Kauffman\\n“I don’t think tariffs will create a lot of manufacturing jobs, at least without a lot of other help,” said Kauffman. “It’s still difficult to find people who have talent and want to work, so we can only create so many jobs of that nature.\\n“Of course, adding technology will help with the overall increase in manufacturing, which is where we are going. We can use technology to help us create custom furniture, but we will most likely never be a source for product that competes with Asia prices.”\\nBontrager at Fusion Designs was more hopeful but still on the doubtful side.\\n“I believe there will only be a short-term benefit to tariffs unless they go higher,” he said. “Right now, a lot of suppliers are avoiding the tariffs by moving out of China, but that doesn’t mean they’re returning to the U.S.\\n\\n“If people knew tariffs would be long term (longer than four years), I think you would see much more investment in American manufacturing. I think a lot of importers at this point are trying to ride it out and looking for temporary solutions.”\\n\\nBontrager said he believes automation will be the only way to compete with low labor costs overseas.\\n“Right now, it seems automation is the only way to compete,” he said. “However, if elevated tariffs remain, I think we could incentivize labor and craftsmanship again, but it would not be cheap, so I am not sure that we could ever compete with Asia on that end. One of the best things we can offer a retailer is that they don’t have to inventory as much. We can build on demand and ship as needed.”\\nLike others, Bontrager said lower-end case goods will be toughest to bring back.\\xa0“It is such a massive investment that I believe most importers look at the risk of making such an investment vs. simply importing and cannot justify the return.”\\nSee also:\\n\\nDo tariffs have the potential to bring furniture manufacturing back to the U.S.?\\nSteel tariffs: Here’s how furniture will be affected\\n\\ns\\nShare this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\nContributor Content ### Importers find reliability, capacity at SC Ports Retailers are experiencing unprecedented consumer demand for[...] April 15, 2021\\nContributor Content ### What the Newest Round of Tariffs Means for Consumer Goods Brands The White House announced that it would impose a 10% tariff [...] July 31, 2018\\n ### Tariff talk hijacks High Point Premarket | Bill McLoughlin Conversations at last week’s Premarket instead were domina[...] March 29, 2025\\n ### Two domestic furniture execs answer: Are tariffs enough to bring jobs back?

An additional 40% anticipated a \"somewhat significant\" effect, while only 2% claimed there would be no impact.\\n\\nPhoto: Dreamstime.\\nThe most anticipated consequence of these tariffs would be increased prices for consumers (87%) and within the supply chain (83%). Respondents also noted other potential challenges, including inflation (71%), production shifts to other countries (68%), retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports (56%), product shortages (44%), and job losses in targeted countries (43%).\\nNearly half (45%) of the respondents predicted that U.S. furniture sales would decrease in the upcoming year due to the tariffs. Conversely, 13% thought there would be a temporary boost in sales as consumers sought to avoid higher prices or shortages. A positive outcome for domestic manufacturers, mentioned by 41%, could be a surge in demand for American-made products.\\nTo mitigate the impacts, furniture companies indicated various strategies, such as increasing prices, adjusting international sourcing, boosting domestic production, stockpiling inventory before tariffs take effect, lay-offs, developing long-term strategies, and adopting a wait-and-see approach. Potential alternative sourcing countries mentioned included Vietnam, India, Brazil, and European nations that have low or no tariffs.\\nConfidence in the tariffs being implemented as planned was mixed among respondents. While two-thirds expressed confidence, nearly 17% thought there might be changes before the new administration took office in January, and 18% were unsure. Most respondents (40%) believed the effects would be immediate, with others predicting impacts within weeks (30%) or months (19%).\\nThe survey also highlighted the reliance on China, Canada, and Mexico within the industry. One-third of respondents noted that over half of their business involved one or more of these countries. Specifically, 57% sourced furniture from China, 34% from Mexico, and 18% from Canada. China was identified as the top sourcing country for 38% of respondents, followed by Mexico (33%) and Canada (27%).\\nThe survey concluded that the upholstery segment would be the most affected, followed by case goods, furniture components, textiles, and mattresses.  \\nSource: www.furnituretoday.com\\nPublication date: Tue 10 Dec 2024  \\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\nPost\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\nMail\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n ### Freight rates hit lowest level since January 2024\\n ### Concerns over Chinese influence at ports\\n ### Trump tariffs highlight US reliance on foreign imports\\n ### Drewry World Container Index continues downward trend as market stabilises\\n\\n ### Shipping company Maersk under fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n ### Euro area trade surplus shrinks to €1.0 billion in January 2025\\n ### OECD economic outlook warns of slower growth amid rising policy uncertainty\\n ### Strongest Dutch export growth in 2.5 years\\n ### Drewry\\'s World Container Index declines as freight rates fall\\n ### Portuguese furniture exports surpass two billion euros despite decline\\n\\nLatest photo reports → See More\\n\\n ### Meble Polska\\n ### January Furniture Show 2025\\n ### Maison&Objet January 2025\\n\\n ### Brussels Furniture Fair\\n\\n\\nFreshpublishers InteriorDaily.com\\n\\nOur Team\\nWork at InteriorDaily.com\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\nPartner Sites\\n\\n\\nWonen360.nl\\n\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAdvertise\\nEmail\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nTerms of Delivery\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nFreshPublishers © 2005-2025 InteriorDaily.com\\n', 'search_term': 'US furniture manufacturers benefiting from tariffs', 'search_explanation': 'Tariffs on imported furniture can help US manufacturers by making foreign furniture more expensive, thus boosting sales of domestic alternatives.'}, 'https://www.furnituretoday.com/tariffs/do-tariffs-have-the-potential-to-bring-furniture-manufacturing-back-to-u-s/': {'title': 'Do tariffs have the potential to bring furniture manufacturing back to ...', 'content': '4 executives expressed a wide array of opinions, from believing tariffs can make a serious positive impact on domestic furniture manufacturing to having little impact at all.', 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-03-18T14:49:45+00:00\\nDo tariffs have the potential to bring furniture manufacturing back to U.S.?

He also seems to be using them as negotiation leverage against Canada and Mexico.\\nBut what do furniture manufacturers think?\\nShannon Williams, CEO of the Home Furnishings Assn., believes that even with tariffs, bringing manufacturing back is going to be a tough task. Particularly with raw materials and labor, she believes manufacturers must find ways to innovate.\\n\\nShannon Williams\\n“Regardless of tariffs, the U.S. labor market cannot support full scale manufacturing. First, most U.S. furniture companies are assembling, not manufacturing,” she said. “About 50% of the components and materials used in production are sourced globally. The U.S. is not manufacturing the wood, metals, textiles, glass, hinges, screws needed for production.\\n“Second, the U.S. unemployment rate is 4%. If 30% of those unemployed could work in manufacturing, we are talking about 2 million jobs across the whole U.S. … for every industry. Asia has hundreds of millions of manufacturing jobs.\\n“Third, the average manufacturing worker overseas is making $13,000 per year,” she continued. “In the U.S., labor costs are 3.36 times that at $43,000. Increased costs will increase prices and affect demand. There are certainly manufacturers that may choose to lean into craftmanship and incentivization for price points that make sense… but there is a large-scale market for low priced furniture that will be impacted. Retailers are already losing a great deal of market share to online marketplaces.”\\nThe three other executives interviewed for this report – who are all domestic manufacturers themselves – had more optimism than Williams, but differed in the amount they had.\\nMost hopeful was Doug Bassett, president of Vaughan-Bassett, one of the largest wooden bedroom furniture makers manufacturing in the U.S.\\n\\nDoug Bassett\\n“There is certainly more potential with tariffs in upholstery than with wood, but still, there’s lots of opportunity on the wood side,” he said. “For wood, the main benefactors would be those of us with significantly sized factories.”\\nExisting companies have advantages over those just starting out, Bassett says, largely due to regulation and permitting.\\n“It’s possible to open up a wood factory, but the permitting process, especially for a finishing room, is a multi-year process,” he said. “In order to crank up wood factories, you would also need to streamline the regulatory process.”\\nWhen asked about Williams’ points that there are not enough domestic labor and American-made materials, Bassett gave rebuttals:\\n“There are 330 million people in the U.S., more than three times as many people as in Vietnam,” he said. “And these are also jobs that used to exist. So I wouldn’t say the people aren’t there. Manufacturing used to be double what it is today, at least as a percentage of our economy. Our free trade policies have caused some of that to move overseas. I believe the administration’s vision is to rebuild some of the manufacturing base.\\n“As for materials, 97% to 98% of the materials we use are American-made,” he continued. It’s really only the screws and some hardware that we don’t. All wood is domestic, whether it’s lumber or veneer, as are our finishing materials. At least in Vaughan-Bassett’s case, we’re not an assembly operation.”\\nGat Caperton, president of high-end solid wood furniture manufacturer Gat Creek, also believes tariffs have great potential. But he also believes expectations must be realistic.\\n\\nGat Caperton\\n“Clearly, tariffs could easily be helpful in bringing manufacturing back and protecting more jobs from going overseas,” Caperton said. “But to bring jobs back in a significant way, we’re going to need lots of investment. We need to have factories expand. We’re going to need to build up an entire supply base. In the past 30 years, wood furniture has swung from 10% imports to 90% imports. I think if you collectively bring some tariffs in, we can grow it by 50%, meaning the pendulum can be swung back from 10% to maybe 20%.\\n“So I’m hopeful,” he continued. “I think we can double U.S. production, but I don’t think we’ll ever get it back to where it was in 1990. Even a modest swing though would be great for the industry and for rural workers.”\\n\\nBased in Dundee, Ohio, Mavin sources nearly everything within a 100-mile radius of its factory.\\nDavid Wallace, sales manager at Ohio-based solid wood manufacturer Mavin, thinks the government will have to do more than just tariffs.\\n“I don’t think tariffs alone will bring back a significant number of furniture manufacturing jobs but would expect them to have some effect on factories like Mavin that are bulking up our production team to meet expected demand increases in the near term,” Wallace said. “So much of our furniture manufacturing infrastructure was offshored years ago, and significant investment in new facilities and equipment would be needed for companies to bring it back, which seems unlikely unless they are incentivized by tax/financial assistance in some way.”\\nWallace believes that Vietnam specifically would have to be targeted.\\n“Vietnam has proven to be the perfect fit of craftsmanship and costs for lower priced case goods,” he said. “To keep retails the same and build in the U.S. would likely mean giving up a lot of styling and reducing quality along with a lot of automation. I think it would take a significant tariff being imposed on Vietnam to move this current model, and manufacturers would exhaust other similar offshore options before considering the U.S. again.”\\nHow much potential do tariffs have to strengthen American furniture manufacturing?

In contrast, just 13% said furniture sales would see an uptick before year-end as consumers tried to avoid potential price increases or shortages.\\nOne potential bright spot for domestic producers would be an increase in demand for American-made products, cited by 41%.\\nWhen asked what measures, if any, retailers and manufacturers planned to take in the face of new tariffs, responses fell into these key camps: raise prices, shift or adjust international sourcing, increase domestic sourcing, make inventory adjustments before the tariffs, implement layoffs or downsizing, develop long-term strategies and take a wait-and-see stance.\\nAmong those considering production shifts, specific countries cited as potential new or expanded sources included Vietnam, India and Brazil along with Europe and, more generally, countries with no or low tariffs.\\nConfidence in the actual implementation of the tariffs as proposed is somewhat unclear for both retail and manufacturing leaders who participated in the poll. Although two-thirds said they were very or somewhat confident the tariffs will be enacted as outlined, another nearly 17% believe there will be changes before the new administration takes office in January, and about 18% weren’t sure which way things will go.\\nIf new tariffs are put in place, the impact is likely to be immediate, according to 40% of respondents. A more delayed reaction is expected by 30%, who see impacts occurring within a few weeks and another 19%, who expect the fallout would be felt in a few months’ time.\\nFor the most part, respondents have some ties to China, Canada and Mexico, with one-third noting more than half of their business is aligned with one or more of the three countries. Among all respondents, 57% said they imported or sourced furniture from China, 34% imported or sourced from Mexico, and 18% did the same from Canada.\\nChina (38%) was also the leading source country among those selling furniture, followed by Mexico (33%) and Canada (27%).\\nAsked which industry segment would be most affected by the tariffs, respondents ranked upholstery as No. 1, followed by case goods, furniture components, textiles and mattresses.\\nSee also:\\n\\nTrump threatens 100% tariffs on nine nations – including China and India\\nHow will tariffs impact domestic furniture manufacturers? 4 execs respond\\n\\n:\\nShare this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\nContributor Content ### Webcast: Distributing Consumer Goods in an E-Commerce World It's no secret the digital economy has reshaped the way cons[...] May 20, 2020\\nContributor Content ### Retailers say training’s key for credit programs What’s the key to consumer financing success for today[...] April 6, 2015\\n ### Consumers ‘gloomy’ about future as Expectations Index hits 12-year low Consumer confidence dropped yet again, marking four months o[...] March 25, 2025\\n ### Home furnishings lags behind other categories among online shoppers Among all of the categories that individuals have available [...] March 24, 2025\\n ### Trend tracker says February appeared steady, but ‘underlying disruptions are emerging’ Circana noted that critical changes are occurring among key [...] March 20, 2025\\n ### February another solid month for furniture sales, says DOC The category showed a sharper sales increase than all other [...] March 17, 2025\\nFurniture Today Daily\\nSignup for your daily digest of industry news and trends.\\n\\nBy signing up you agree to our\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\nTariffs\\nRetail\\nFinancial & Business News\\nManufacturing\\nPeople\\nObituaries\\nLicensing\\nResearch\\nSupply Chain\\nEcommerce\\n\\n\\nMarkets\\nEdit Invites\\nAtlanta\\nHigh Point\\nLas Vegas\\nShowtime\\nTupelo\\n\\n\\nProduct & Trends\\nBedding\\nRugs\\nTechnology\\nHome Accents\\nOutdoor Furniture\\nUpholstered Furniture\\nResearch Store\\nEdit Invites\\nBuyers Guide\\n\\n\\nOpinion\\nReader Rankings\\nFurniture Everyday\\nInsider’s View\\nMattress Matters\\nTech Talk\\nLogistics Logic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvents\\nMarkets\\nClassifieds\\nGalleries\\nVideo\\nPhotos\\n\\n\\nPress Releases\\nBTM Business Connect\\nProfessional Announcements\\nBehind The Deal\\n\\n\\nAdvertise\\nAdvertise\\nMarketing Tips\\nGrowth Guide\\nMedia Kit\\nEditorial and Special Products Calendar\\n\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nABOUT\\nFurniture Today is the complete information source for the furniture industry featuring retailer and manufacturing news, plus product trends and market analysis.\\nCONTACT\\n\\nAbout Furniture Today\\nContact Us\\nAbout BridgeTower Media\\nAccessibility Statement\\n\\nADVERTISE\\n\\nAdvertise\\nMarketing Tips\\nFree eGuide\\nMedia Kit\\n\\nCONNECT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\nSign up to get exclusive industry information delivered to your inbox.\\nNETWORK\\n\\nDesigners Today\\nGifts & Decorative Accessories\\nHFN\\nHome Accents Today\\nHome Textiles Today\\nPet Age\\n\\n\\n© 2025 BridgeTower Media.

The American South largely benefited from this shift, not just in wood furniture but also upholstery produced in places like North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi.\\nFollowing this same model, many of us in the industry today witnessed the shift of manufacturing to Taiwan, China and even the Philippines in the early and mid-to-late ’90s to the early 2000s. There, workers would earn a fraction of what they were making to build not just similar products, but products that ended up becoming even more complex in their construction and use of materials.\\n\\nOther lower-cost countries soon also would benefit from this race to lower-cost labor including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and eventually India.\\nUltimately, the products coming from every one of these countries would bring an enhanced fashion statement largely to case goods that showcased highly carved elements along with mixed-media elements from mirrors and glass to decorative marble, metals and more.\\nChina was largely the main source for these looks, but Vietnam soon caught up as many Taiwanese and Chinese-owned plants moved to Vietnam to produce bedroom in response to antidumping on Chinese-made wooden bedroom furniture dating back to 2003 and 2004.\\n\\nOther categories such as home office, home entertainment and dining soon followed as it became more efficient to produce these categories in factories that could match finishes and veneers along with other decorative elements in-house, creating not just a one-stop shop for many customers, but also vertically integrated facilities that were steadily gaining expertise in the fabrication and incorporation of mixed materials into the product mix.\\n\\nThe upholstery segment, which has largely remained domestic, would benefit from the global production of leathers, fabrics and other woven materials used in the mix, not to mention imported frames, mechanisms and motors that are part of the ever-growing motion upholstery segment.\\n\\nMost consumers likely understand that this type of global supply chain has benefited not just the furniture industry, but many other product categories as well, from autos to phones and computers to washers and dryers and refrigerators, to name several.\\n\\nEven the venerable C.F. Martin & Co., which has produced high-end guitars in this country dating back to 1833, has a label on the bracing inside its instruments that reads, “Made in Nazareth, Pa. with Materials Sourced Around the World.”\\n\\nThis is more than just a requirement from the FTC regarding information about where its products are actually produced: made mostly with several exotic wood species — whose tonal properties can calm the soul and even ease a blistering headache — the instrument is a living, breathing testament to reality of the global supply chain.\\n\\nSo here we are once again facing the prospect of tariffs. The ideas being bandied about are not only to raise tariffs on China-made products to 60%, but also potentially impose tariffs on most other countries that could be as low as 10% to 20% but in some cases as high as 100%. Canada and Mexico face tariffs of 25%, as we’ve reported previously.\\n\\nIt’s a possibility that has the industry concerned to say the least, although we collectively have to admit that we saw it coming, just as we saw it coming several years ago with the threat of tariffs on China, which were imposed in 2018 to the tune of around 25%.\\n\\nAt the time, many companies were able to move production to other parts of the world, namely Vietnam, which ended up being a major beneficiary as its furniture shipments to the U.S. expanded significantly.\\nFor example, according to Mann, Armistead & Epperson, furniture shipments from Vietnam rose from $4.3 billion in 2018 to just over $10 billion in 2021, while shipments from China fell from $19.1 billion to $13.9 billion during the same period. During that same period, wood furniture shipments from Vietnam would eclipse those from China, rising from $3.3 billion in 2018 to nearly $5.8 billion in 2021. China’s furniture shipments, meanwhile, fell from $5.7 billion to $2.7 billion during the same period.\\n\\nIf tariffs are imposed as anticipated, it’s unclear what the outcome will look like, although some retail customers have reportedly been shopping domestic sources. That’s a good thing for American companies and U.S. workers as it could help bring some jobs back to the U.S., which is among the key goals of tariffs in the first place.\\n\\nThe challenge for the furniture industry is that most of the manufacturing and jobs have long since disappeared, with only a handful of key players on the wood side of the business. While the domestic producers we’ve spoken with are eager and able to take on some of that business moving forward, there will be some other challenges.\\n+ U.S. wood production capacity is nowhere near what it was before the shift in manufacturing to Asia. With many plant closings and thousands of jobs lost in the process, it would take years to rebuild a furniture manufacturing base. Most banks for one would probably never fund such a thing, given what they know about the industry’s draw to low-cost labor. Thus, the investment would be considered risky at best should tariffs decrease and retailers once again push for lower-cost product from Asia. That’s not to say that existing producers would not continue to survive and thrive with increased demand. It’s just unlikely that we will see much future investment in new start-up wood furniture plants.\\n+ Many younger workers have seen the devastation and havoc the industry imposed on their parents and grandparents whose jobs were lost during the transition to Asia. Hence while many younger workers are still entering the furniture workforce, it’s likely in product development, sales, marketing and retail. For many, working in a furniture plant is nowhere near as attractive as it was a generation or two ago, particularly on the wood side of the business. The question then becomes, who would fill these jobs? Plus, with an increase in automation and robotics, there may not be as many jobs for manufacturing workers after all.\\n+ Consumers stand to lose out both in terms of the looks and overall values they have come to expect. As we alluded to earlier, Asia has long filled the void in style-driven looks resulting from their ability to incorporate mixed-media elements into the mix ranging from marble and stone to metal, glass and mirrored accents made popular by collections ranging from Tommy Bahama at Lexington, Jessica McClintock at American Drew to Jane Seymour at AICO. Most U.S. wood plants simply don’t work with these materials any longer. Thus, we’ve come to see a host of clean-lined designs, some of which are void of much shape, texture or depth. Finish is where many of these producers excel, but that is just one aspect of what many consumers are seeking in design. Of course, luxury furniture producers still provide these types of multidimensional designs, but many of them are still having them produced in Asia.\\n\\nAICO’s Portrait bedroom features this panel bed with marbleized insets that light up. The nightstands on either side also feature marble inset tops.\\n+ With the exception of say Vaughan-Bassett and John Thomas, there also are few other mid-to-upper-middle-priced resources in domestic case goods. What’s produced in the U.S. is either starting-priced promotional, or at the upper end with producers such as Century, Gat Creek, Vanguard and Hickory Chair, to name a few. That leaves a huge void in the middle, where most furniture is sold. Thus with tariffs in place, consumers could either have to become accustomed to the very entry-level starting price points or expect to pay more for their furniture. Of course, some imported furniture still could be affordable, but it will come at a higher price with additional tariffs. So inflation as we know it could reach levels far beyond what all the critics of the Biden administration ever dreamed.\\n+ Upholstery is a bright spot for the U.S. consumer as there are plenty of domestic manufacturers across nearly every price point in places such as North Carolina, Virginia and Mississippi, for example. And those with available capacity could take on even more business in the months ahead, which is certainly a positive for those businesses and their employees. But as we’ve noted previously, they too could fall victim to tariffs, particularly those that import components such as plywood frames, fabrics and leathers along with mechanisms and motors for motion furniture. As those components are as vital to the upholstery mix as wood and veneers are to case goods, consumers should expect prices of those goods to increase as well.\\nThese are just several factors for the furniture and other U.S. companies to consider as the issue of tariffs begins to emerge in the coming weeks and months. Fortunately, the industry can begin planning as we’ve heard many are already doing. But given the depth of the global supply chain, this is not going to be an easy one to figure out. And it could end up to be painful not only for suppliers and the retailers they serve, but also consumers who truly believed the inflated sales pitch that they were going to be better off than they’ve been in the past several years.\\nPost navigation\\nPrevious Post Previous post: The drive to succeed: Partnering with automakers\\nNext Post Next post: The Last Word with Todd Wanek, president and CEO of Ashley Furniture\\n\\nThomas Russell\\nHome News Now Editor-in-Chief Thomas Russell has covered the furniture industry for 25 years at various daily and weekly consumer and trade publications.
