## Purpose

Accurate estimation of future returns and risk is one of the most challenging aspects of portfolio optimization. The estimators module aims to provide a variety of methods to:

1. Forecast expected returns for different assets
2. Estimate volatility and correlation between assets
3. Capture complex market dynamics and factor exposures
4. Provide inputs for the optimization algorithms

## Planned Estimator Types

### Historical Estimators
- Sample mean and covariance from historical data
- Rolling window approaches with various lookback periods
- Resampling and bootstrapping techniques

### Factor Models
- CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) for single-factor estimation
- Fama-French 3-factor and 5-factor models
- Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) implementation
- Custom factor model creation and calibration

### Statistical Models
- GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) for volatility
- EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) for time-varying estimates
- Covariance shrinkage methods (Ledoit-Wolf, etc.)
- Robust covariance estimation techniques

### Machine Learning Approaches
- Linear and non-linear regression for return forecasting
- Support Vector Regression for volatility estimation
- Neural networks for capturing complex patterns
- Ensemble methods combining multiple approaches

## Features

- Consistent API across different estimation methods
- Backtesting capabilities to evaluate estimator performance
- Visualization tools for factor exposures and correlation matrices
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification

## Integration with Optimizers

The estimators will be designed to work seamlessly with the optimizers module:

```python
# Example of planned integration
from estimators.factor_models.fama_french import FamaFrenchEstimator
from optimizers.monte_carlo_optimizer import MonteCarloOptimizer

# Create and fit the estimator
estimator = FamaFrenchEstimator(model_type="five_factor")
estimator.fit(tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "META"], 
              start_date="2020-01-01", 
              end_date="2023-01-01")

# Get the estimates
expected_returns = estimator.get_expected_returns()
covariance_matrix = estimator.get_covariance_matrix()

# Use with optimizer
optimizer = MonteCarloOptimizer(
    tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "META"],
    estimate_method="custom",
    expected_returns=expected_returns,
    covariance_matrix=covariance_matrix
)

# Run optimization
result = optimizer.run_monte_carlo(n_simulations=10000)
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The estimators will be evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for return forecasts
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for volatility estimates
- Information Ratio when used in portfolio construction
- Realized vs. predicted correlation metrics
- Portfolio performance using the estimates
